Was in the MICU from\n   [**4-23**] until the night of [**4-29**].  See the initial admission note and last\n   night's transfer note for details of her presentation and hospital\n   stay.\n   .\n   In short, she was admitted and started on a heparin gtt which was\n   difficult to titrate to a therapeutic range.  She remained hypoxic with\n   O2 sats in the high 80s to low 90s while on high flow mask and nasal\n   canula.  Over the course of her stay, she became therapeutic on the\n   heparin and was started on coumadin on [**4-26**] after being therapeutic for\n   24 hours.  She was weaned from the high flow face mask to a venti mask\n   and then nasal canula overnight.  She was otherwise normotensive with\n   mild tachycardia to high 100s throughout her hospitalization.  She had\n   pain control with IV morphine and then PO oxycodone/oxycontin for her\n   post-surgical pain.\n   .\n   On transfer to the floor last night, she triggered for a SBP in the\n   80s.  She had just received all her pain medications, and her BP\n   quickly normalized after a fluid bolus.  Then she triggered again this\n   morning for marked nursing concern with increased upper and lower back\n   and \"lung\" pain.  She had desatted to the high 80s on her nasal canula\n   and was placed back on a venti mask.  Her oxygenation saturations\n   improved to mid 90s after being placed back on the mask.\n   .\n   During evaluation, she was tachypneic and uncomfortable, complaining of\n   middle upper back pain and pain with deep breaths.  She was afebrile,\n   her BP was 110/80, P 98.  She was 92% on venti-face mask.  She had\n   already received her morning pain meds and was not comfortable.  She\n   was given IV morphine and ativan.  She had a CT torso to evaluate lung\n   parenchyema and for RP bleed.  Her hct was stable today at 29 and had a\n   therapeutic INR.  Her herparin was stopped.\n   .\n   She was transferred to the MICU for nursing concern about her hypoxia.\n   Patient admitted from: [**Hospital1 5**] [**Hospital1 **]\n   History obtained from [**Hospital 19**] Medical records\n   Allergies:\n   Ambien (Oral) (Zolpidem Tartrate)\n   Headache;\n   Last dose of Antibiotics:\n   Infusions:\n   Other ICU medications:\n   Other medications:\n   Past medical history:\n   Family history:\n   Social History:\n   (Per prior admission note)\n   Past Medical History:\n   Obesity\n   Gastric Bypass\n   s/p anterior L4-S1 fusion\n   .\n   Medications:\n   Oxycodone 5 mg [**2-8**] Tablet(s) every 4 hours, as needed\n   Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tab Twice Daily\n   Tizanidine 4 mg Tab Daily, at bedtime\n   Quetiapine 50 mg Tab Daily, at bedtime\n   Cyanocobalamin 50 mcg Tab Daily\n   Multivitamin Tab Daily\n   Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tab Daily, at bedtime\n   Venlafaxine ER 225 mg 24 hr Tab Daily\n   Doxidan (bisacodyl) 5 mg Tab Oral 2 Tablet Once Daily, as needed\n   OxyContin 20 mg 12 hr Tab every 12 hours\n   .\n   Transfer MEDS:\n   see OMR\n   .\n   Allergies:\n   Ambien\n   no hx of blood clots; otherwise non-contributory\n   Occupation:\n   Drugs:\n   Tobacco:\n   Alcohol:\n   Other: Lives with husband, runs food service supplying mixes for\n   breads/brownies/etc to chain stores.

Ortho is following along.\n   - will continue home pain control regimen of oxycontin, oxycodone and\n   tizanidine; morphine PRN as above\n   - ortho requesting AP & lateral L-spine x-rays prior to d/c\n   - follow up ortho recs if any\n   .\n   # Anemia: hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. Will\n   continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. No active evidence of\n   bleeding.  No bleed seen on CT\n   - monitor hct daily\n   .\n   # Anxiety: Will continue venlafaxine, clonazepam, quetiapine. Social\n   work has seen patient.  Continues to be anxious and crying.

I agree with\n   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add\n   the following:\n   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3033**] is well-known to the MICU service, having presented last\n   week with extensive bilateral PEs.  She was called out yesterday to the\n   floor but returns to us with ongoing hypoxemia and new pleuritic chest\n   pain on L.  Pt has been therapeutic on her Coumading CTA today shoes\n   ongoing extensive bilateral PEs as well as scattered groung glass\n   infiltrates, which are most prominent in the LUL.  There is also a\n   component best viewed on chest/abdomen windows that appears to be\n   pleural-based in the LUL and a new L-sided effusion.  I suspect that\n   her pleuritic CP is due to distal inflammation/pleuritis as a late\n   consequence of her PEs but we will also treat her for hospital-acquired\n   PNA.  Her oxygenation is stable at the moment.\n   [**Name2 (NI) **] is critically ill.

Within\nthe right distal femoral vein, inferior to the bifurcation\n(SFV), an echogenic clot is seen. Flow was seen around this\nclot. The remaining vessels demonstrate normal compressibility,\nflow and augmentation.\n\nOutside Hospital CTA Scan:  massive b/l PE\n\nTTE [**4-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular\nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic\nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is\ndilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of\naortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic\nvalve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.\nThere is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There\nis no pericardial effusion.\n\nCTA Chest [**4-30**]: IMPRESSION:\n1. Minimally increase in large pulmonary artery clot burden on\nthe right\nsince 1 week prior. The pulmonary artery remains almost the same\ndiameter as the aorta suggesting mild pulmonary hypertension.\nThere are no other signs to suggest right ventricular strain.\n2. Left upper lung ground glass opacities may represent\ninfectious etiology, asymmetric ventilation from pulmonary\nembolus or foci of hemorrhage.\n3. New small, left greater than right pleural effusions.\n4. No RP bleed.\n5. Small splenic infarct.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on\n[**2172-4-7**] who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.\n\n# Pulmonary embolism (provoked): Per reports from OSH, and per\ndiscussion with radiologists at [**Hospital1 18**] and review of the images,\npt has diffuse PE's bilaterally, with very little lung\nperfusion. Pt was started on oxygen and a heparin drip (with\nwhich there was initially some difficulty in obtaining\ntherapeutic PTT) as well as coumadin.
