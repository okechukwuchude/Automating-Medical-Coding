The size of the cardiac silhouette is\nat the upper range of normal, there are no signs indicative of\noverhydration. Moderate  tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The\nhilar and mediastinal contours are  unremarkable. There is no\nabnormal parenchymal density, notably no indication for the\npresence of atelectasis or pneumon\n\nEMG [**2192-2-27**]\nIMPRESSION:\nAbnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for\nmoderate median\nneuropathies at both wrists and for a mild, chronic L5\nradiculopathy on the left. The impersistent upper extremity F\nwaves would be consistent with early Guillian-[**Location (un) **] syndrome;\nhowever, there was no other evidence for this entity. This may\nbe due to the fact that the study was performed only 4 days into\nthe course; if concern remains for a demyelinating\npolyneuropathy (as in Guillian-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome), this test could\nbe repeated in [**1-27**] weeks as it may be normal in very early\ncases. The poor activation seen in most muscles tested on needle\nEMG may be due to pain, poor patient effort, or central nervous\nsystem dysfunction.\n\nLYME SEROLOGY (Final [**2192-3-1**]):\n      NO ANTIBODY TO B.
