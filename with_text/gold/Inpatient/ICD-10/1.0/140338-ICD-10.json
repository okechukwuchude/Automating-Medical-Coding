The tracing represented an anesthesized patient with\npre-central beta activity extending somewhat more posteriorly\nand\nrepresentative of a benzodiazepine effect. One isolated instance\nof\nvertex activity that might have represented stage II sleep was\nseen.\n.\nEKG on admission: Sinus rhythm at 94 bpm, normal axis, normal\nintervals, rsr' pattern in V2. TW flattening in III/avF.\nOtherwise no acute ST or T-wave changes.\n.\nEKG on transfer to floor: NSR 95bpm, nl axis and intervals, no\nTWI or ST segment elevations or depressions\n.\nKUB: No evidence of drug packing. NG terminates below the\ndiaphragm\n.\n[**2189-7-21**] CXR: Compared to [**2189-7-20**], the bilateral subtle basal\nopacities have minimally improved. The opacity along the minor\nfissure is no longer visible. No newly occurred focal\nparenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusion,\nunchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Complete resolution of\nRUL opacicity.\n.\n[**7-22**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity\nsize. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There\nis no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size\nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally\nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral\nvalve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure\nis normal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n#. Cocaine Overdose: Pt with massive ingestion of 14g of crack\ncocaine. He was intubated in the field and transferred from\n[**Hospital6 3105**]. He was given 14mg ativan total at the\nOSH and 40mg valium in the ED.  Pt underwent NG lavage and also\nreceived activated charcoal and started on Golytely. CT-head was\nnegative at OSH. Pt tachycardic and BP elevated at OSH, but\ncontrolled in the ED with valium IV.  Tox screen neg at OSH\nother then cocaine and BZD. In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was extubated on\n[**2189-7-20**] and remained stable on oxygen by NC. Additionally a\ntoxicology cosult was called and recommended KUB to rule out any\nretained packages in the bowel which is negative.  His vitals\nsigns: HR, BP, all remained stable after transfer to the floor.\nNo additional benzodiazepine was required.\n\n# Rhabdomyolysis: Pt was started on IVF for elevated CK to 3226.\nPt was monitored for signs of hyperthermia and tachycardia. On\nthe floor, CK steadily trended down and was 287 day before\ntransfer. UA did not show myoglobinuria. His renal function\nremained stable.\n\n#. Depression: On further questioning, the pt reported that the\ncocaine ingestion was a suicide attempt.  He stated that he was\nhaving more financial difficulty over the past few months and\nthought that if he attempted suicide, his family would be able\nto receive his life insurance.  A 1:1 sitter was ordered and\npsychiatry consult was called. He was placed on a Section 12 and\nis currently awaiting an inpatient psychiatry bed for further\nevaluation.  He denied any futher suicidal ideations while in\nthe hospital.\n\n#. Fever: Pt developed fever to 101 with leukocytosis on [**2189-7-20**].\nBCx were sent with no growth to date and CXR was concerning for\naspiration pneumonia, but final read demonstrated no infiltrate.\n His fever defervesced while blood and urine culture remained\nnegative. WBC also trended down and normalized. Unasyn was dc'd\non [**2189-7-23**]. Pt was felt to have aspiration pneumonitis and\ntherefore was not continued on antibiotics. He remained afebrile\nwithout cough or shortness of breath.\n\n#. NSTEMI:  Likely demand ischemia in the setting of cocaine\noverdose causing vasospasm and not acute thrombosis. No prior\nhistory of CAD or risk factors per family. Heparin gtt was held\ngiven risk for intracranial bleed. Pt was started on ASA 325mg\nand lipitor 80mg. Beta blocker was contraindicated. Cardiac\nenzymes trended downwards. EKG normalized. ECHO showed no LV/RV\nor valvular function. Lipid panel was wnl and statin was\nstopped.  Pt switched to ASA 81 mg given no cardiovascular risk\nfactors.\n\n#. Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminitis with no prior\nfor comparison.  Likely related to crack cocaine ingestion.\nNon-obstructive picture. Tylenol neg at OSH.  Possible ischemia\nrelated in the setting of cocaine over dose. LFTs began to trend\ndownward while on the floor and normalized on [**7-23**]. Hepatitis\nserologies were negative.\n\n# Comm: [**Name (NI) 82820**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82821**]; [**Doctor First Name **]- [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82822**]\n\n# Dispo - to psych inpatient unit for further management of\ndepression\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTramadol\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital 1680**] Hospital - [**Location (un) 538**]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\nCocaine overdose\nNSTEMI\nHyperthermia\nAspiration pneumonitis\nDepression\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nAfebrile, vital signs stable, medically cleared for discharge.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital after ingesting a large amount\nof cocaine. You were admitted to the intensive care unit for\nclose monitoring. The large cocaine caused muscle pain and\nfevers, and also caused a small amount of damage to your heart\nmuscle. You recovered quickly with treatment. We checked an\nechocardiogram and it showed no evidence of significant damage.\n\nYou were evaluated by the psychiatrists, who feel that you'd\nbenefit from inpatient psychiatric treatment.\n\nChanges to your medications include: aspirin 81 mg daily.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease follow per psychiatry recommendations.\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2189-7-24**]"

Cocaine Overdose: Pt with massive ingestion of 14g of crack cocaine.\n   He was intubated in the field and transferred from an OSH. He was given\n   14mg ativan total at the OSH and 40mg valium in the ED.  Pt also\n   received activated charcoal and started on Golytely. Pt tachycardic and\n   BP elevated at OSH, but controlled in the ED. CT-head was negative at\n   OSH. Tox screen neg at OSH other then cocaine and BZD.\n   - appreciate Tox recs ([**Month (only) 11**] consider consulting surgery for enterotomy\n   for uncontrollable hyperthermia, tachycardia and seizure)\n   - Valium 10-20mg q5-10mins for agitation\n   - cont GoLytely 2L per hour until GI tract clear (activated charcoal is\n   only affective within the first hr of ingestion per tox)\n   - Neuro eval for EEG (although unlikely status since pt given 14mg\n   ativan at OSH)\n   - cont IVF\n   - Urine and serum tox screen\n   - Monitor ECG\n   - trend CE and CK q8 initially\n   - trend BMP\n   - monitor temperatures of hyperthemia\n   - monitor VS: treat uncontrollable hypertension/tachycardia with\n   phentolamine 5-10mg every 5-10mins prn\n   .\n   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated by EMS for air-way protection\n   following cocaine overdose. The patient was initally paralyzed with\n   vecuronium initially. In the ED, he was sedated with propofol and given\n   valium. ABG: 7.41/42/159/28.  CXR did not show acute process. CMV,\n   Tidal Vol:600, PEEP:5, FiO2:40%, PIP:21.\n   - repeat ABG and adjust vent setting accordingly\n   - cont sedation with propofol and valium as above\n   - follow abg\n   .\n   #. NSTEMI: In the setting of cocaine overdose. No prior history of CAD\n   or risk factors per family. Likely ischemia in the setting of cocaine\n   overdose causing vasospasm and not acute thrombosis.  Will hold on\n   heparin gtt given risk for intracraial bleed\n   - ASA 325mg\n   - lipitor 80mg\n   - Maintain HR <100 with valium, CCB if needed\n   - ECHO to eval wall motion\n   - cont to trend CE\n   - BB contraindicated\n   .\n   #. Transaminitis: Pt with elevated transaminitis. No prior for baseline\n   comparison.  Possibly related to crack cocaine ingestion or adulterated\n   with other substance. Non-obstructive picture. Tylenol neg at OSH.\n   Possible ischemia related in the setting of cocaine over dose.\n   Otherwise, pt with underlying hepatitis also a possibility.\n   - will check serum tox and urine tox\n   - check hepatitis serologies\n   - cont to trend LFT\n   .\n   # FEN: IVF, replete lytes, NPO\n   .\n   # Access: 2 PIV\n   .\n   # PPx: subq heparin, PPI\n   .\n   # Code: FULL\n   .\n   # Dispo: ICU\n   .\n   # Comm: [**Name (NI) 7536**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7537**]\n   [**Doctor First Name 5018**]- [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7538**]\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2189-7-20**] 03:28 AM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: SQ heparin\n   Stress ulcer:  PPI\n   VAP:  HOB elevation, mouth care,\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:  FULL\n   Disposition:  ICU\n"
