A catheter or\npacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD\nby 2D or color Doppler.\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were\nobtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly\ndilated LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Mildly\ndepressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed\ngiven the severity of valvular regurgitation.]\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.

I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA\nregulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout\nthe procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears\nto be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with\nthe MD caring for the patient. Bilateral pleural effusions.\nConclusions\nPRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo\ncontrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No\nmass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial\nappendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left\natrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is\ndepressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is dilated. No atrial\nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular\nwall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed\n(LVEF= 40-45 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function\nis likely more depressed given the severity of valvular\nregurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with\nmoderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma\nin the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic\narch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic\naorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but\naortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The\nmitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is bileaflet\nprolapse with a flail P2 segment and potentislly some A2 partial\nflail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the\nresults in the operating room at the time of the study.\n\nPOST BYPASS The patient is receiving milrinone and\nnorepinephrine by infusion. The right ventricle displays normal\nsystolic function. The left ventricle displays septal dyskinesis\nversus severe dysynchronous contraction which is new from the\npre-bypass study. The rest of the LV segments are glbally,\nmoderately depressed. Overall left ventricular ejection fraction\nis approximately 35%. There is a bioprosthesis located in the\nmitral position. It appears well seated. The leaflets have\nnormal motion. There is trace valvular mitral regurgitation. The\nmaximum gradient through the valve was 6 mmHg with a mean of 2\nmmHg at a cardiac output of 3.5 liters/minute. The thoracic\naorta is intact after decannulation.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2161-2-2**] 16:09\n\n\n??????

He\ntolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in\ncritical but stable condition. He awoke neurologically intact,\nalthough slow to wake and was extubated on POD#2. He was weaned\noff inotropes and pressors and was started on\nBeta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis. All lines and drains\nwere discontinued in a timely fashion. Mr.[**Known lastname **] was confused on\nPOD#2 and narcotics were discontinued. His mental status\nimproved to baseline. He continued to progress and was\ntransferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.\nPhysical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and\nmobility. On POD# 4 an unwitnessed slip vs.fall occurred and Mr.\n[**Known lastname **] was not able to fully weight bare immediately thereafter.\nOrthpeadics was consulted and a CT scan was performed. Per Ortho\nMr.[**Known lastname **] was cleared for discharge with partial weight baring\non his left lower extremity until follow up in [**11-23**] weeks with\nDr.[**First Name (STitle) 4223**] in orthopeadic oncology.
