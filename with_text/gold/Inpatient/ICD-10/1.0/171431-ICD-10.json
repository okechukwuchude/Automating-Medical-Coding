Less likely , hypersensitivity\npneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia , vasculitis or COP may be\nalso suggested. Clinical correlation is recommended.\n\n[**2196-10-7**] CXR: The CT scan of one day prior demonstrates scattered\nareas of\nground-glass opacity throughout both lungs, predominantly in the\napices. The current x-ray study, though limited as above,\ndemonstrates increased density in the left perihilar and lower\nlung regions. It is unlikely that the process noted on the CT\nhas resolved; however, some of the opacity in the left lung that\nis now visualized may be due to atelectasis. If clinically\nfeasible, consider PA and lateral view for more sensitive\nevaluation. However, there is likely underlying evolving\ninfection as detailed in the chest CT report.\n\n[**2196-10-9**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable. The\npatient is in mild volume overload. There is still no focal\nconsolidation demonstrated with the focal areas of ground-glass\nopacities seen on prior chest CT from [**2197-1-5**] can be\nseen in the left upper lung and as previously mentioned might\nrepresent infectious process.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n27 yo female with MMP incl asthma, fibromyalgia and tobacco\nabuse admitted to ICU for hypoxia/respiratory distress.\n\n# Respiratory distress/hypoxia: On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],\npatient was satting at 97%-100% on NRB.  Patient reports this\nepisode felt different from her usual asthma exacerbation as she\nfelt much worse this time. The differential diagnoses included\nCAP pneumonia / atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, influenza\ncomplicated by asthma exacerbation.  PE, ACS, CHF on\ndifferential but unlikely.  Eosinophilic PNA less likely as no\nperipheral eosinophila, no other signs of vasculitis at this\ntime (ESR and CRP only mildly elevated).  Per patient's PCP\npatient has long reported excessive mold in her building which\ncould be significant given ddx includes hypersensitivity\npneumonitis. Patient was put on Levoquin for possible CAP vs\natypical pna. CXR showed no consolidations or clear infiltrate;\ntogether with her clinical exam of severe wheezing, this was\nmost consistent with viral pneumonia complicated by asthma\nexacerbation despite her negative viral cultures.  Patient was\nput on Advair, Flovent, Xopenex. In addition, solumedrol and\nsingulair were started. Patient was initially put on high flow\naerosol mask, which was slowly weaned to nasal cannula. On the\nday of transfer to floor, patient walked 3 laps on ICU floor on\nroom air with oxygen saturation of around 93%. While on the\nfloor she remained stable, with improvement in her tachycardia.\n\n# Chest pain: Differential included pneumonia, asthma\nexacerbation and chest tightness, PE, GERD, anxiety or ACS.  EKG\nshowed no acute changes. Patient had very low risk for CAD.\nCardiac enzymes were negative x 2. Outpatient percocet was\ncontinued.\n\n# Fibromyalgia: Patient complained of bilateral leg pain on\nadmission. Home Percocet q4-6h PRN was continued for pain. Home\ndose Lyrica was continued as well.\n\n# Depression: Stable.
