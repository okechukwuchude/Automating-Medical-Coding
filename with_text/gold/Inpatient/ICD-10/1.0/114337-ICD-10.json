Borderline size of\nthe cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of\npneumonia or pleural effusions. Retrocardiac atelectasis. No\npneumothorax.\nCT abd/pelv [**2183-3-17**]:  IMPRESSION:\n\n1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.\n\n2. Incompletely characterized 15 x 11 mm splenic hypodensity. In\nthe absence of a history of malignancy, incidental splenic\nlesions are typically benign.\n\n3. Pancreatic calcifications, some may be vascular, but raising\nconcern for chronic pancreatitis. No CT evidence of acute\npancreatitis.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n89 yo F h/o alzheimers dementia, COPD, Bipolar d/o presenting\nwith fever, tachycardia, and an elevated lactate.\n.\nSepsis: With fever, tachycardia and elevated lactate and\npossible PNA and cellulitis consistent with sepsis. Patient was\nstarted on vancomycin and cefepime.  She was switched to\nbactrim/doxycycline PO. Her blood pressure was low on night of\nadmission and received a total of 8 liters of IVFs over\napproximately 16 hours. Her blood pressure then normalized after\nthis intervention. Patient was called out of the MICU within 24\nhours of admission. On arrival to the medicine floor, patient's\nantibiotics were switched to augmentin/bactrim for cellulitis\nand azithromycin for questionable atypical pneumonia.  Knowing\nthat patient had recent urinary tract infection, urine culture\nresults were obtained form [**Doctor First Name 1191**] which showed sensitivity to\nnitrofurantoin, which patient had been treated with prior to\nadmission. AVSS throughout stay on medicine floor.\nHer rash was not classic for cellulitis given the\nvesiculo-pustular appearance and symmetry; it appeared more like\na contact dermatitis, although without known exposure. We\nunroofed a vesicle and sent for HSV/VZV DFA which is pending at\ntime of discharge. Also would consider medium potency topical\nsteroid cream.\nPatient will be continued on augmentin/bactrim x 5 more days and\nazithromycin x 3 more days.\n.\nGoals of Care: ICU attending held discussion with HCP regarding\ngoals of care and it was decided that patient would not benefit\nfrom escalation of care.  This included NO central line or\npressors.  Patient would likely benefit from DNH (do not\nhospitalize) order.\n.\n[**Last Name (un) **]: Elevated at 1.7 from baseline near 1.0. After IVFs, patient\nCR decreased to 1.5 and stabilized at 1.3.  PO fluid intake was\nencouraged throughout the hospital stay.\n.\nCOPD: Currently not on any inhalers, however has been in the\npast, ordered combivent nebs prn.  Did not require any PRNs\nwhile in house.\n.\nDementia: Reportedly due to alzheimers and with recent\naggressive behavior. Continued donepezil 10 mg daily. Patient\ndid not require PRN medications and remained calm and oriented\nthroughout her stay on the medicine floor\n.\nBipolar d/o: Recent medication adjustment at [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital.\nContinued [**Hospital3 4107**] regimen of Seroquel 12.5 prn,\ncitalopram 20 mg daily, Divalproex and gabapentin as well.\nPatient did not require any PRN medications for agitation while\non the medicine floor\n.\nAnemia: Stable. No transfusions in the MICU.  Remained stable on\nemdicine floor\n.\nSplenic hypodensity: CT scan showed splenic hypondensity, given\nhistory of malignancy, could be followed up with further\nevaluation although may not be compatible w/ goals of care.\n.\nCode: DNR/DNI\n.\nTransitional issues - HSV/VZV DFA pending at time of discharge;\ntopical steroid cream not yet started\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications: Per [**Doctor First Name 1191**] [**Month (only) 16**]\nCitalopram 20 mg Once Daily\ndocusate sodium 100 mg at bedtime\ndonepezil 10 mg qhs\nMVI\nOmeprazole 20 mg daily\nSimvastatin 20 mg daily\nGabapentin 100 mg TID\nDivalproex 125 mg [**Hospital1 **] (0900 and 1400)\nDivalproex 250 mg qhs\nNitrofurantoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nSaliva Substitute 2 mL QID after meals and HS\nFluocinolone acetonide [**Hospital1 **]\nAcetaminophen 650 daily\nMaalox q4H prn\nMgOH daily prn\nQuetiapine 12.5 mg q6h PRN and 25 mg q6H prn\nAlbuterol prn\nbisacodyl 10 mg PRN\nLasix 60 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n2. donepezil 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at\nbedtime).\n3. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n4. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n5. gabapentin 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3\ntimes a day).\n6. divalproex 125 mg Capsule, Sprinkle Sig: One (1) Capsule,\nSprinkle PO BID (2 times a day).\n7. divalproex 125 mg Capsule, Sprinkle Sig: Two (2) Capsule,\nSprinkle PO HS (at bedtime).\n8. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
