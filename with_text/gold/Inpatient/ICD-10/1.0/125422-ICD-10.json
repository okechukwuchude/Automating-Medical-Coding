There is\nmoderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal\ncavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).\nThe estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.\nThere is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nstructurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There\nis moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.\nPulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic\nregurgitation.\n\nVIDEO SWALLOW STUDY: Penetration with thin and nectar\nconsistency. No aspiration. Very slow passage of contrast\nthrough the thoracic esophagus into the stomach with numerous\ntertiary waves seen.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of COPD and CHF who presents with hypoxia\nand SOB, consistent with pulmonary edema.\n\n#dCHF EXACERBATION: Physical exam and CXR consistent with\npulmonary edema. Likely because lasix dose was recently\ndecreased. Patient's new ativan medication could have\npotentially make her hypercarbic, but shouldn't contribute to\nhypoxemia. She was afebrile and without leukocytosis. She\nreceived 1 dose of Levofloxacin in the ED. The patient was\nadmitted to the MICU with respiratory distress and agitation.\nShe was placed on BiPAP intermittently overnight but continued\nto remove the mask. Her SpO2 was at baseline. She continued to\nremain agitated but was somewhat redirectable. Swallow consult\nplaced and lasix 60mg PO daily ordered on day of transfer out of\nMICU. Patient continued to improved and had no shortness of\nbreath while on the floor. Her ECHO demonstrated The left and\nright atria are moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric\nleft ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated\ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.\nIn conclusion, we recommend not decreasing the current lasix\ndose in this patient. She will need this dose titrated in the\nfuture to make sure she does not become volume overloaded again.\n\n# Anxiety: Patient had been suffering from this anxiety for\nseveral years. In hospital it was initially controlled with\nalprazolam. However, she was evaluated by inpatient psychiatry\nwho recommended to d/c alprazolam and use 0.25 mg lorazepam TID\n(about equivalent to the 0.125 mg alprazolam TID prn she had\nbeenreceiving at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab before recent increases).\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid.\n# Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled. Allergic to beta\nblockers. Not anticoagulated, likely because of history of\nfrequent falls.\n#COPD  - stable\n- albuterol neb\n- fluticasone nasal spray\n- Fluticasone/salmeterol discus\n#Code: DNR,DNI.

PCP may need to reevaluate the need for\nthyroid supplementation in this patient. As per psych: The\npatient's daughter reports that she had equivocal TFTs in\nthepast and against the daughter's better judgment, her doctors\ndecided to [**Name5 (PTitle) **] thyroxine.  If in fact the thyroxine is not\nnecessary, tapering the thyroxine may contribute to a reduction\nin her experienced anxiety.\n\n#Anxiety - patient is being discharged to rehab on lorazepam, as\nper psych recommendation. Her sertraline dose may need to be\nadjusted based on how she is doing at the [**Hospital **] rehab in the\nnext few weeks.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.
