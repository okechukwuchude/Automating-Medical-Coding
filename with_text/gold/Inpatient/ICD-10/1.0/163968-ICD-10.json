Prominence\nof vascular markings at the hilum bilaterally. Attenuation at\nthe right costophrenic angle, and mildly at the left\ncostophrenic angle.\nFindings could suggest congestion, bibasilar atelectasis,\npleural effusion, more on the right, and/or pneumonia especially\nat the left lung base. Findings could also be seen in\ninterstitial lung disease. Please correlate clinically. Old rib\nfractures at the left lung base.\nQuestion of a nondisplaced rib fracture at the right mid rib. If\nthere is a clinical concern, designated rib film could be done\nto evaluate this further.\n.\nCTA chest - IMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli. Large saddle embolus in the right\nmain\npulmonary artery and segmental left lower lobe branches with\nassociated\nperipheral airspace opacification and small right pleural\neffusion. Bowing of the intraventricular septum and increased\nratio of the right to left ventricle suggestive of possible\ncomponent of right heart strain.\n2. Enlarged heterogenous appearance with multiple nodules noted\nin the left thyroid lobe compatible with multinodular goiter.\n3. Diffuse ground glass opacity and interlobular thickening\nsuggestive of\ncomponent of congestive heart failure.\n4. Moderate in size sliding hiatal hernia.\n5. Atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic aorta.\n6. Old left healed rib fractures.\n7. 4mm right lower lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule. Recommend\nclinical\ncorrelation with risk factors, and if patient is high risk, a\ndedicated chest CT can be obtained in 6 months for further\nevaluation.\n.\nPortable chest - FINDINGS: The heart size is normal. Persistent\ntortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Interval improvement in\ninterstitial pattern. Small right pleural effusion has possibly\nincreased in the interval with adjacent atelectasis. Minimal\nlinear atelectasis at left lung base.\n.\nCT head - CONCLUSION: Chronic findings unchanged since [**Month (only) **]\n[**2154**]. No evidence of hemorrhage.\n.\nCXR-FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-28**], there is\nlittle overall change. Continued small right pleural effusion\nwith adjacent atelectasis and minimal streaks of atelectasis at\nthe left base. Mild prominence of interstitial pattern without\nevidence of acute focal pneumonia.\n.\nECHO-The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.\nThe estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size\nand regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated\ncardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging\nsuggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure\n(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.\nMild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n78 y.o. F with remote CVA, remote DVT, admitted with large\nbilateral pulmonary emboli, initially stable on floor but\nrequired ICU stay for hypercarbic respiratory failure\n\n# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: PCO2 on ABG with hypercarbic\nrespiratory failure. This was thought to be secondary to\ndecreased respiratory drive given oxygen supplementation,\npossibly underlying COPD. AMS resolved with decreasing O2\nsupplementation from 3 L NC to 1 L NC. Patient without\ndocumented history of COPD but has 25 pack year smoking history.\nHer goal O2 sat 88-93%. Narcotic use and psychotropic\nmedications were avoided.  Pt's mental status now appears back\nto baseline, conversant, alert.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Occurred in the setting of hypercarbia.\nHead CT obtained on floor prior to ICU transfer which was\nnegative.\n.\n# Pulmonary emboli: large bilateral PE.  CT exhibited evidence\nof right heart strain but echo showed intact RV function.   Pt\ndid not require thrombolytic therapy. She remained\ncoumadin/heparin gtt until INR therapeutic. Pt is currently in\nthe therapeutic range.  Pt should have her INR checked in [**1-11**]\ndays.\n.\n# Right sided rib pain: Thought to be secondary to pleuritic\npain cause by pulmonary emboli. This pain made deep breathing\ndifficult. However, pain gradually resolved with standing\ntylenol. She was written for morphine prn but did not require.\nShe was advised to perform incentive spirometry.\n.\n#pulmonary edema: Pt developed transiently in the ICU in the\nsetting of IVF for hypercalcemia. She was given additional 20mg\nIV lasix with good effect.\n.\n# Hypercalcemia: Pt found to have hypercalcemia especially in\nthe setting of low albumin. PTH was high, phos tended to be on\nthe lower side. This makes primary hyperparathyroidism the most\nlikely. She was given lasix and IVF with good effect. Her\ncalcium and vit D supplementation were stopped. She should\ncontinue this workup in the outpt setting.\n.\n# GERD: Pt given omeprazole as per outpt regimen.\n.\n# Hypertension: patient with a history of hypertension\nmaintained on outpatient beta blocker and lasix. This was\ncontinued.\n.\n# Schizophrenia: Pt with remote history but did act\nappropriately during hospitalization. She was continued on her\nolanzapine as per outpt regimen.\n.\n# Urinary incontinence - patient maintained on outpatient\nOxybuynin as this is chronic medication for her\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMOM PRN\nCalcium Carbonate 2 tabs by mouth PRN heartburn\nArtifical tears drops QID OU\nMetoprolol tartrate 75 mg PO BID\nTramadol 25 mg PO BID\nVitamin D 400 Units PO BID\nTylenol 650 mg PO TID with ultram\nMirtazapine 15 mg PO qhs\nFleet enema PRN constipation\nDulcolax PRN constipation\nLasix 20 mg PO daily\nOcuvite 1 tab PO daily\nMultivitamin 1 tablet PO daily\nPrilosec 1 tablet PO daily\nZyprexa 2.5 mg PO qhs\nOxybuynin 5 mg PO BID\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were given blood\nthinning medications heparin and coumadin to prevent further\nclot formation.  Shortly after hospitalization, you were found\nto be more confused, and were tranferred to Intensive care Unit\nfor observation. Your confusion resolved.  Your pain was\ncontrolled with Tylenol. You were also found to have high level\nof calcium, and it was determined that this was due to high\nlevels of Parathyroid hormone.  You were given water pill Lasix\nand IV fluids to lower the levels of blood calcium.  Over the\ncourse of your hospitalization, your pain became better\ncontrolled, your breathing and oxygenation have improved.\n\nDuring hospitalization, several of your medications were\nchanged.\n1.Your calcium was stopped\n2.Your vitamin D was stopped\n3.You were started on a blood thinning medication, coumadin for\nyour blood clot for which you should likely take for a lifetime.\n4.Your mirtazapine and tramadol were stopped secondary to\nconfusion, you should discuss with your PCP resuming these\nmedications.\n5. oxygen as needed.
