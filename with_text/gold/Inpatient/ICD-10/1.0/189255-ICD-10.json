No left atrial appendage\nthrombus, velocities in LAA > 20 cm/s. There is mild symmetric\nleft ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size\nis normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low\nnormal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear\nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation.\n\nPost Bypass: Pateint is AV paced on Phenylepherine infusion.\nPreserved biventricular function and wall motion. LVEF 55%. No\nchange in valvular function. Aortic contours intact. Reamaining\nexam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the\ntime of the exam.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nAdmitted [**2152-1-23**] for heparin bridge and surgical evaluation.\nOn [**1-24**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery, see operative report for\nfurther details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative\nantibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit for\npost operative management.  In the first twenty four hours he\nwas weaned from sedation, awoke, and was extubated without\ncomplications.  On postoperative day one he was started on\ndiuresis and beta blockers.  He was doing well and was\ntransferred to the floor for the remainder of his care.\nPhysical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  On\npost operative day three he went into atrial flutter in\ncontrolled rate and was treated with beta-blockers and\namiodarone.  Coumadin was resumed.  He was discharged home on\nPOD 5 with appropriate follow up instructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\npravastatin 40mg daily\nwarfarin 6mg daily\nlisinopril 40mg daily\ntoprol 50mg daily\nasa 81mg daily\ncymbalta 30mg daily\nbupropion XL 300mg daily\nomeprazole 20mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. pravastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
