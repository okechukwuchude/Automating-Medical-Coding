Patient was\ninitially admitted to unit for labile BP, including hypotension.\n Patient reports recently being treated for UTI at an OSH with\nlevofloxacin and macrobid.  He was discharged home with\nmacrobid.  He endorses increasing episodes of autonomic\ndysreflexia over the past few days despite being treated for\nESBL UTI.  He presented to OSH yesterday with these symptoms,\nand was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  The\npatient had endorsed chest pain that was not [**3-7**] ACS, and had\nCTA chest that was negative for PE.\n.\nApproximately 8 months ago he began experiencing episodes of\nautonomic dysreflexia. The muscle spasms associated with these\nepisodes are extensor only and begin in his legs and move\nproximally to involve his hips, middle and upper back. Each\nextensor spasm lasts only a few seconds, is recurrent every few\nminutes, and is painful, culminating in discomfort in the left\nchest region. Associated with the spasms are: acute onset severe\nheadaches, blurred vision, mild sweating/hot feeling, and a\nfeeling of disorientation. Systolic blood pressure (taken at\nwork and at home) during these episodes is elevated to the\n170-200 range. Sitting upright helps reduce the spasms and\nsymptoms of autonomic dysreflexia.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 81 122/64 18 100, though he\nalso had an episode of hypotension in the 60s. Patient was given\nvancomycin for concern for sepsis. Dropped pressures to the\n60's.  The patient received IVF and had a clonidine patch was\nremoved. Admitted to MICU for hypotension with ? sepsis.\n.\nIn the MICU, patient continued to complain of spasms. He denied\nany dysuria, fevers, or chills. Patient reports foley catheter\nwas last changed about a week ago. His UTI was positive for P.\nAeruginosa. His antibiotics were changed from zosyn to\nmeropenem.  His foley catheter was changed.\n.\nOn the medicine floor, the patient endorses spasms.  He denies\nchest pain/SOB.  He also denies f/c.  He has no abdominal pain.\nHe is concerned about his urologic care.  He had been followed\nby a urologist until recently.  He had a scheduled urodynamic\neval that he was not able to keep [**3-7**] his recent\nhospitalization.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n(1) Traumatic C6 quadroplegia from car accident in [**2069**]\n(2) Neurogenic bladder, has had indwelling foley catheter for\nlast 10 years.\n(3) Dysreflexia - autonomic and somatic\n(4) Spasticity\n(5) Multiple UTIs (including ESBL E. coli)\n\nSocial History:\nLives alone, not married, no children.

Patient likely has\nchronic urinary tract infection or incompletely eradicated\nurinary tract infection.  He does have a recent history of ESBL\nE. Coli in the urine. He was initially started on Zosyn as prior\nESBL E. coli was listed as sensitive, but given this is also a\nbeta-lactam, he was converted to meropenem on the morning\nfollowing admission. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive\nPseudomonas.  Meropenem was continued, as patient had recent\nhistory of quinolone-resistent Enterococcus UTI and ESBL E. coli\nin past few months.  He was continued on home medications of\nDetrol and imipramine.  He was discharged on [**2102-5-26**] to rehab to\ncomplete a 10 day course of meropenem, a PICC was placed prior\nto discharge.  The patient will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Urology at [**Hospital1 18**]\non [**2102-6-5**] to establish care and for evaluation of his recurrent\nUTIs and possible uro-dynamic studies, as he does not have\naccess to urologic care at home.\n\n# Autonomic Dysreflexia/Spasticity - Symptoms were likely\nexacerbated by urinary tract infections causing worsening of\nspasticity. Previous exacerbations of autonomic dysreflexia have\nimproved with treatment of underlying UTI. BPs were monitored\nclosely and improved to baseline levels on teh morning following\nadmission. The patient was continued on home doses of\nbaclofen/diazepam/clonazepam.  The patient required nitro paste\ntwice in the setting of elevated BP, with good effect.\n\n# Depression/Anxiety. The patient was continued on home doses of\nimipramine, and sertraline.\n\n# Osteopenia. Likely due to non-weight bearing status, muscular\natrophy, and possible autonomic nervous system changes. The\npatient was continued on his home calcium/vitamin D.\n\n# GERD. Patient was continued on his home omeprazole.\n\n# FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, heart healthy diet\n# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen\n# Access: peripherals\n# Communication: Patient\n# Code:  Full (discussed with patient)\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

You were transferred here from [**Hospital3 **] because\nyou were having muscle spasms, fast heart rate, and high blood\npressure consistent with previous episodes of autonomic\ndysreflexia. In our emergency department you had low blood\npressure and were admitted first to the ICU and then to the\ngeneral medicine [**Hospital1 **]. You were found to have a urinary tract\ninfection with a bacteria called pseudomonas aeruginosa. We\nthink that the UTI probably exacerbated your autonomic\ndysreflexia. We treated your infection with an antibiotic called\nmeropenem and you got better. We made plans for you to continue\nyour treatment in a rehab center and to follow-up with a\nurologist as an outpatient.\n\nPlease note that the following medications have changed:\n-Meropenem\n-No other changes were made to your medications.\n\nPlease see below for your follow up appointments.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease follow-up with the following:\n\nDepartment: SURGICAL SPECIALTIES\nWhen: MONDAY [**2102-6-5**] at 1 PM\nWith: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 161**] [**Name6 (MD) 162**] [**Name8 (MD) 163**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 921**]\nBuilding: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\n\n\n"
