In\naddition, since he does not have a spleen, need to have clinical\nsuspicion for infection with encapsulated organism. The\nhypercarbia that he initially had in the ED was likely due to\ndecreased respiratory rate  due to somnolence, which was likely\nfrom combination of alcohol and methadone use. Urine legionella\nnegative. CXR shows improvement after 1 day of antibiotic\ntherapy. Pt states recent HIV and PPD testing at PCPs office.\nHowever, PCP has not seen pt in >1year. Pt was initally placed\non vanco, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. However, as clinical\nsuspicion for MRSA PNA was low, vanco was discontinued. He will\nbe discharged on azithromycin and cefpodoxime. Pt refused\npneumonvax vaccination. PPD was placed and was read negative on\n[**2185-7-11**]. Sputum was sent for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pending.
