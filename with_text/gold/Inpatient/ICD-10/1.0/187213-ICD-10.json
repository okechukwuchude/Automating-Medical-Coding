The rhythm appears to be A-V paced. Results were\nConclusions\nPRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium\nis elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body\nof the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium\nor left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is\npresent in the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is\ndilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal\ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be\nfully excluded. The basal and mid right ventricular free wall\ndisplays normal contractility. There are simple atheroma in the\naortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.\nThere are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\nThere are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets\nare severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve\nstenosis (valve area = 0.6cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.\nA mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The gradient across\nthe mitral valve is increased (mean = 9 mmHg). There is moderate\nvalvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5cm2). Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the\nresults in the operating room at the time of the study.\n\nPOST BYPASS The patient is initially being AV paced and then A\npaced. The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. There\nis normal biventricular systolic function. There is a\nbioprosthesis in the aortic position. It is only very poorly\nseen. It does appear well seated but the leaflets cannot be\nvisualized. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The maximum\ngradient across the valve was 60 mmHg with a mean gradient of 40\nmmHg at a cardiac output of 6.5 liters/minute. These gradients\nare higher than expected. The effective orifice area of the\naortic valve was 1.2 cm2. The mitral valvular function is\nessentially unchanged. The thoracic aorta appears intact.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2156-12-8**] 15:06\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted on [**2156-11-29**] and underwent cardiac\ncatheterization on [**2156-12-1**] which revealed: severe aortic\nstenosis and minor irregularities of the coronary arteries.  Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and the patient had a preop workup which\nconsisted of a dental consult and carotid studies which showed\n<40% stenosis on the right and 60-69% stenosis on the left.  She\nalso had a chest CT to evaluate her aorta and was treated for a\nUTI.\nOn [**2156-12-8**] she underwent redo sternotomy/aortic valve replacement\nwith a 21mm tissue valve.  Her cross clamp time was 70 minutes\nand her total bypass time was 98 minutes.  She tolerated the\nprocedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable\ncondition on Neosynepherine and Propofol.  She was extubated on\nPOD#1 and she did well until POD#2 when she developed severe\npost operative pain and received pain medicine which sedated her\nand she became confused.  She required aggressive respiratory\ntherapy.  Her chest tubes were discontinued on POD#2 and she was\nstarted on coumadin.  Her epicardial pacing wires were\ndiscontinued on POD#2 as well.  She continued to slowly progress\nand her mental status completely cleared and she was transferred\nto the floor on POD#5.  She was discharged to rehab in stable\ncondition on POD# six by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
