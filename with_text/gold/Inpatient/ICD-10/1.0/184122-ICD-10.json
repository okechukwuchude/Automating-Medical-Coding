She\nsays she has noticed increased difficulty breathing over the\npast\nmonth, but this has been noticeably worse over the past week.\nThis is exacerbated by laying flat. Over the past week, she has\nnoticed it more difficult to either walk or talk. She says over\nthis time, she also has a lot of phlegm production and is having\ndifficulty clearing the mucus from her throat; she says \"it\nfeels\nlike there is a big glob of mucus in my throat\". She notes\ndifficulty swallowing because of the mucus that she feels liks\nis\nstuck in her throat. She does not think she would have\ndifficulty\nswallowing if there was no mucus there. She was able to eat\nbreakfast and drink liquid today without choking.\n  With regards to her myasthenia, she was diagnosed in [**2161**]\nafter\npresenting with diplopia and is s/p thymectomy. She has been\ntreated with Cytoxan, Prednisone and Azathioprine in the past.\nHer Neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 47763**]. She is\ncurrently taking Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg daily and Prednisone 15 mg\ndaily. The Cellcept was started in [**2178**] for erythema nodosum.\nThere have been no recent changes to her medications. In the\npast, her myasthenic exacerbations have usually been\ncharacterized by either diplopia or severe weakness, but has had\nrespirartory exacerbations many years ago. Of note, last year,\nshe was admitted with dyspnea and was diagnosed with\nbronchospasm\nthat was relieved with Albuterol. At that time, difficulty with\nclearing secretions was not an issue as it is now. She did try\nan\nAlbuterol inhaler earlier this week with little relief, but did\nnote some improvement with Albuterol nebs at her PCP office\nearlier in the week. She tried an Albuterol inhaler today at\nhome, which did not provide any relief. For her exacerbations,\nshe takes Mestinon prn along with Atropine. She tried taking 30\nmg Mestinon this past weekend, with little effect. She has never\nbeen treated with IVIG or Plasmapheresis in the past.\n\nNeuro ROS: Dysphagia associated with mucus, but cannot rule out\ncontribution of underlying myasthenia. No headache, loss of\nvision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, lightheadedness,\nvertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No difficulties\nproducing or comprehending speech. No focal weakness, numbness,\nparasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. No\ndifficulty with gait.\n\nGeneral ROS: Positive for the dyspnea, mucus production and\ndifficulty with coughing/clearing secretion. No fever or chills.\nNo chest pain or tightness, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No dysuria.

No parenchymal opacity\nsuggesting\npneumonia.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n47 year-old left-handed woman with PMH significant for\nmyasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], HTN, and DM who presents with increasing\nshortness of breath over the past month and difficulty clearing\nsecretions over the past 1-2 weeks. On exam, she appears to be\nbreathing comfortably, though her voice is somewhat nasal and\nseems to be affected by increased mucus and she is notably\nhaving difficulty clearing her secretions. She has mild right\nptosis (though lid not covering pupil) and is unable to close\neither eye tightly, which are old findings. There are otherwise\nno focal deficits on her exam. Her dyspnea, worse with lying\ndown and her difficulty clearing secretions are concerning for a\nmyasthenic crisis.\n\nNeuro:\nHer NIF and VC were low on admission (-22 and 850 respectively)\nand she was thus admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to\npossible impending respiratory decompensation. Her Mestinon was\nincreased to 30mg Q8 and her prednisone was increased to 40mg\ndaily. She was continued on Cellcept 1g daily. She improved on\nthis regimen and was transferred to the floor on [**12-15**]. Her\nneurologic exam remained stable with mild weakness of eye\nclosing b/l but full neck flexors/extensors and full strength\nthroughout.\n\nRespiratory:\nHer respiratory status was monitored closely with Q4hr NIF and\nVC as well as continuous O2 sat monitoring. Her NIF and VC\nsteadily improved during her admission and she remained stable\non room air. CXR x 2 were negative for pneumonia.\n-continuous O2 sat monitoring\n\nCV:\nShe was maintained on tele monitoring throuhgout her admission.\nShe was continued on her home Losartan for BP control.\n\nGI\nShe was cleared by speech/swallow for a regular diet with thin\nliquids. She was continued on her home Ranitidine given daily\nPrednisone use.\n\nEndo\nShe was continued on her home Glipizide and maintained on\nfingersticks ACHS with SSI.\n\nID\nShe remained afebrile with no signs of infection during her\nadmission. CXR was negative for pneumonia.\n\nDVT proph:\nShe was maintained on hep SQ for DVT prophylaxis.\n\nBy [**2187-12-16**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] had improved symptomatically and her\nrespiratory status had also improved with NIF -70 and VC 1L. CXR\nwas again negative for pneumonia. She was discharged home in\ngood condition on increased doses of Mestinon 30mg TID and\nPrednisone 40mg daily, in addition to Cellcept 1g daily.

As\nyou have myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] we were concerned that this\nrepresented a myasthenic crisis.  You have had flares of your\nmyasthenia before but this was the first time you had any\nrespiratory involvement.  Your initial pulmonary funciton tests\nwere concerning, however after review of you records it seems\nthat they are not far off your baseline.  You were admitted to\nthe ICU for close monitoring.  As you had decreased your\nprednisone over time, and were on a once a day dosing of\nCell-cept, we increased the dose of prednisone to 40mg daily,\nand increased the dosing of cell-cept to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].  We\ndiscussed these changes with your outpatient neurologsit Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Your pulmonary tests improved over the next day and you\nwere discharged from the intensive care unit.  We had another\nchest x-ray done and you were discharged home.\n\nYour medications we changed as follows:\nPrednisone increased to 40mg daily\nCell - Cept (mycophenolate mofetil) increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]\nMestinon: can take more frequently as needed\n\nYou should take all medications as prescribed.  Please make all\nfollow up appointments, particularly with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  If you\nhave any concerns about problems breathing, problems swallowing,\nproblems speaking or weakness, you should call your doctor and\nreturn to the nearest emergency room, as this may represent a\nflare.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease follow up with your outpatient neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\nyou have an appointment in [**Month (only) **].  As it is the holiday\nweekend the office is currently closed and we cannot confirm\nthis but it is important that you follow up with him\n\nPlease also see your PCP:  [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 8031**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
