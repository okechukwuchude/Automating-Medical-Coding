A preprocedure timeout confirmed the patient\n identity and the procedure to be performed.  The patient was brought to the\n neuro interventional suite, and the bilateral groins were prepped and draped\n in the usual sterile fashion.  Using a 19-gauge single wall needle, the right\n common femoral artery was accessed, and an 8 French sheath was placed over a\n [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire.  Using the [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire and a 4 French Berenstein 2 catheter,\n the left common carotid artery was selected and an angiogram was performed.\n This demonstrated complete occlusion of the M1 segment of the left middle\n cerebral artery.  The 4 French Berenstein catheter was therefore exchanged for\n an 8 French Merci balloon catheter which was parked in the cervical left\n internal carotid artery.  Then, using a gold tip Glidewire and a Merci\n emergency microcatheter, the thrombus in the left M1 division was reached, and\n crossed.  At this point, approximately 5 mg of TPA was infused into the\n thrombus.  A 2.0 soft Merci retriever was then placed, and over a period of\n five minutes, gentle traction was applied and thrombectomy was attempted.  A\n 3.0 firm Merci retriever was then placed across the occluded portion of the\n left M1 segment, and two further attempts were performed with the application\n of gentle traction over a period of 5 minutes.  Angiogram following these\n attempts demonstrated a patent M1 segment of the left internal carotid artery,\n distal M2 branches remained patent, however, a more proximal M2 branch\n demonstrated slow flow, signifying more distal occlusion.  Approximately 5 mg\n of TPA was infused into this M2 branch. The catheter was then removed,\n followed by removal of the sheath over a wire. Hemostasis was achieved using\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2128-8-27**] 2:17 PM\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 12512**]\n Reason: inetervention for stroke\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 160\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n an angioseal device and manual compression.
