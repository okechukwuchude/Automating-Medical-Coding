However, this most likely reflects primarily the\nchange in\npatient position, as there is continued large effusion with\ncompressive\natelectasis. The right IJ sheath has been removed. Lower lung\nvolumes and\nsome atelectatic changes are also seen at the left base.\n\nDR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1569**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11006**]\nApproved: MON [**2127-11-10**] 2:29\n\nTEE [**2127-11-7**]\nConclusions\nPRE-BYPASS:\nThe left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or\nthrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial\nappendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial\nappendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color\nDoppler.\nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal\ncavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThe aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There\nis critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild\n(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before\nsurgical incision.\n\nPOST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 50%\nThe aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well with a\nmean residual gradient of 15mm of Hg.\nIntact thoracic aorta. No new valvular findings.\n\n\n[**2127-11-10**] 05:50AM BLOOD WBC-10.4 RBC-3.06* Hgb-9.5* Hct-28.7*\nMCV-94 MCH-31.1 MCHC-33.0 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-195\n[**2127-11-11**] 05:30AM BLOOD UreaN-35* Creat-1.6* Na-138 K-4.3 Cl-101\n[**2127-11-10**] 05:50AM BLOOD Glucose-124* UreaN-31* Creat-1.4* Na-138\nK-4.2 Cl-104 HCO3-26 AnGap-12\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:\n\nThe patient was brought to the operating room on [**11-7**] where the\npatient underwent [**2127-11-7**] AVR(21 StJude epic/porcine). Overall\nthe patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively\nwas transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery\nand invasive monitoring.\n\nPOD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact\nand hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and\nvasopressor support.\n\nBeta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed\ntoward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to\nthe telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and\npacing wires were discontinued without complication.  He\ndeveloped junctional rhythm, beta blocker was decreased and\nsinus rhythm returned.\n\nThe patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility.\n\nBy the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating\nfreely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral\nanalgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA in good\ncondition with appropriate follow up instructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nDORZOLAMIDE-TIMOLOL 2 %-0.5 % Drops - 1 gtt in each eye [**Hospital1 **],\nSULFAMETHOXAZOLE-TRIMETHOPRIM 800 mg-160 mg [**Hospital1 **],  TRAVOPROST\n0.004 % Drops - 1 gtt ou daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO\nQ4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
