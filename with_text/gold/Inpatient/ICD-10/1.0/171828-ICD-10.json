His weight loss and anorexia are complicated\nby the history of hiatal hernia.  Our recent CT evidence showed\nparaesophageal hernia which patient underwent an UGI EGD.  The\nGI team did not observed a significant obstruction during this\ntest.  Barium swallow, however, did show some signs of slow\npassage at this juncture.  He had a complete infectious workup\nwith echo and CT of head for possible other source of\ndisseminated fungal infection.  ID was consulted and felt that\nthere were no infectious etiology to explain the course of FTT.\nHe had Geriatric, GI and Psychiatry evaluation.  Per Geriatric\nrecommendations, we have started him on Ritalin and titrate up\nto 5mg QAm and 2.5 mg Qnoon.\n.\nHe was to go for planned surgical repair of hiatal hernia on\n[**12-15**], unfortunately, this was put on hold due to CONS infection\nlikely from the PICC.  He was transferred to the MICU for closer\nmonitoring.  He received broad spectrum coverage initially.\nPICC line was removed and cultured.  He was then narrowed to\nvancomycin (completed 2 week course) and IV fluconazole.  After\na two day stay, he was transferred to the floor with signs of\nfluid overload due to IVF resuscitation.\n.\nOn floor, he maintained largely stable.  He underwent PEG\nplacement and hiatal hernia repair on [**2190-12-22**].  He did well.\n.\n# Vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, h/o psoas abscesses- Per ID,\nrestart fluconazole given normal LFTs. There were improved fluid\ncollections on CT, with no evidence of para-spinal fluid\ncollection. ESR would suggest ongoing infection, although CRP is\nimproved.  He was continued on fluconazole 400mg IV daily during\nthe hospitalization.\n.\n# [**Last Name (un) **]- Fe Na 1.3% though still suspect pre-renal physiology;\nhowever, given recent antifungal and antibiotic, could be due to\nATN.  There were no evidence of hydronephrosis on CT, with\ndecompressed bladder. No evidence of UTI.  His renal function\nimproved with aggressive IVF.  He was not able to take in PO to\nkeep up with his output.\n.\n# h/o Deep Venous Thrombosis: Noted IVC clot on CT, with\nnon-occluded IVC filter.  His Warfarin was restarted on [**2190-12-24**]\nhe was given 1 mg, 3 mg on [**12-25**] (INR 1.4), 26 (INR 1.5)& 27\n(INR 1.9). INR on [**12-28**] 2.4 decreased dose to 1 mg daily.\n.\n# AAA s/p EVAR- stable. continued anti-hypertensive meds, ASA,\nstatin.\n.\n# h/o hiatal hernia- continued PPI, Barium swallow showed\nquestionable slowing of passage at the hernia, EGD was negative\nfor any obstructive symptoms.  He is not a surgical candidate\ncurrently.\n.\n# Anemia of Chronic Disease: On recent labs, normocytic\nnormochromic with high RDW and with low iron, low TIBC, iron sat\n27% all indicate anemia of chronic disease superimposed with\ncomponent of iron deficiency.  He was transfused one unit of\nblood and responded appropriately.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism: normal TSH, continued levothyroxine 125 mcg\ndaily\n.\n# PICC line: PICC line: 5 French right basilic venous approach.\nFinal internal length is 42 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC.\nThe line is ready to use.\n\nID: developed loose stools on [**2190-12-28**].
