Shortly post-op, while in the PACU, he\nexperienced a significant increase in pain and swelling in the\nleft femur and was returned to the OR for four-compartment\nfasciotomy. A large hematoma was evacuated from underneath the\nvastus and the muscles remained viable. The compartments felt\nsofter, though still with some swelling, and the wound was\nclosed with assistance from two VAC sponges. During this time,\nhe also developed a pneumothorax, confirmed on CXR, and a chest\ntube was placed. Post-op, he was admitted to the TSICU. On\n[**2112-5-23**], orthopedics took the patient back to the OR for I&D of\nleft thigh and leg and closure, after which he was admitted to\nthe floor. On [**2112-5-24**], the pneumothorax resolved and the chest\ntube was removed.

Coronal and\n sagittal reformats were displayed.\n\n CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe (2:26 - 28)\n and right lung base (2:40) likely corresponds to parenchymal contusion.  There\n is no associated rib fracture or pneumothorax.  The lungs are elsewhere clear\n without mass or pleural effusion.  The heart and great vessels are\n unremarkable without pericardial effusion.  There is no aortic injury.  There\n is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Residual thymic tissue\n is noted.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and\n adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast\n symmetrically.  The non-opacified stomach and loops of small and large bowel\n are unremarkable. There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen. No mesenteric\n or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley\n catheter.  Small locules of gas in the anterior portion of the bladder are\n likely related to Foley catheter placement.  The distal ureters, prostate,\n seminal vesicles, sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no free\n fluid in the pelvis.  Contusion and edema of the left obturator internus and\n vasti muscles is noted.  There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There\n is no free fluid in the pelvis.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2112-5-19**] 8:08 PM\n CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 68639**]\n CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST\n Reason: trauma eval\n Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 130\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  There is a transverse fracture through the left superior pubic\n ramus.  In addition, an ossific corticated density is noted adjacent to the\n left 10th thoracic transverse process and may be related to old trauma.  No\n other fractures are identified.  No suspicious osteosclerotic or osteolytic\n lesions are present.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Probable small pulmonary contusions in the left lower lobe and right lung\n base.\n\n 2.  Left superior pubic ramus fracture with associated contusion and edema of\n the left obturator internus muscle.\n\n 3.  Contusion and edema of the left vasti muscles, likely related to known\n femur fracture evaluated on dedicated femur radiographs.\n\n 4.  Corticated ossific density adjacent to the left 10th thoracic transverse\n process likely related to old trauma.\n\n"

Evaluate for\n pulmonary embolus.\n\n COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2112-5-19**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Axial imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to the\n diaphragm following the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast.\n Multiplanar reformations were provided.\n\n CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no pulmonary embolism.  Bilateral\n pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right, and small on the left, have\n developed since two days ago.  There is resulting compressive subsegmental\n atelectasis.  Fluid is also seen along the right major fissure posteriorly\n (2:44).  Small parenchymal pulmonary opacities in the left lower lobe are\n again consistent with pulmonary contusion.  Right upper lobe nodular/ground\n glass opacities may be inflammatory or infectious.\n\n No residual pneumothorax is seen, although subcutaneous emphysema tracks\n around the site of the left chest tube, which apparently terminates just\n superior to the left lung apex.\n\n The heart, aorta, and great vessels appear normal.  Although not tailored for\n the purpose, limited axial images of the upper abdomen appear unremarkable.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  No evidence of PE.\n\n 2.  New bilateral pleural effusions with subsegmental atelectasis.\n\n 3.  Pulmonary opacities in the left lung base posteriorly consistent with\n contusion.\n\n 4.
