[**Name (NI) **] wife\nreports a steady decline over the last week, culminating on the\nday admission with inability to walk or verbalize. Patient was\nseen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in clinic on Monday, and LP was performed. This\nLP showed no evidence of infection. Patient is not on\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy at this time. Wife reports\nthat patient was able to function minimally over the past week\nbut since night prior to admission has really not been able to\nwalk or verbalize. He is able to follow commands and understand\neverything that is spoken to him. Patient triggered on arrival\nto ED for nursing concern.\n\nOf note, he was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 8767**] with\nconfusion that was attributed to cerebral edema from his head\nmetastases. He carries a diagnosis of melanoma metastatic to the\nhead, lung, and liver. He was receiving treatment from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at\n[**Hospital1 3278**], including gamma-knife in [**2163-3-10**], and had multiple\nsimilar admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] for confusion that improved\nwith pulse dexamethasone.  Attempts to wean steroids were met\nwith worsening confusion. He and his wife chose to transfer care\nto [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  He follows in the\nbiologics clinic here, receiving off-label ipilimumab.  He\nreceived a huge bolus of dexamethasone (10mg at home, 10IV in\nthe ED) with improvement of his confusion, however his FSG\nascended into the 400s requiring insulin coverage.  They\nremained elevated in the 300 range at the time of discharge- and\nhe was sent out on metformin with FSG testing supplies, and an\nappointment with his [**Name8 (MD) 6435**] NP was established within a few days\nof discharge to assess the need for insulin.  He unfortunately\nfailed to followup, and his FSG were 300+ at home.  4-5 days\nprior to admission he noted progressive weakness and decreased\nstrength of voice prompting ED presentation.\n\nOn admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a glucose of 432 and an anion\ngap of 30.  He was treated with an insulin gtt, aggressive\nhydration, and repletion of electrolytes.  His gap subsequently\nclosed and  basal/bolus SubQ insulin was started, guided by\n[**Last Name (un) **] consult.  FSG were still intermittently into the 300-400\nrange, and glargine was uptitrated as needed.\n\nIn the ED, T 98.4 HR 109 BP 142/96 RR 16 Sat100%RA. CT head was\ndone and per prelim report shwoed multiple hyperattenuating\nsupratentorial lesions with surrounding edema compatible with\nmetastatic disease, unchanged since [**2163-8-1**] CT exam. CXR did\nnot show acute process. UA was not suggestive of UTI. ALT was\nnotable to be 49 otherwise normal LFT. Lactate was 2.1. Serum\ntox was negative.\n\nOn arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were: 98.1, HR 111, BP\n135/80, RR 13, Sat 97%RA. FS 242.\n\nReview of systems:\n(+) Per HPI, constipation\n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies shortness of\nbreath, cough, dyspnea or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest\npressure, palpitations. Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or\nbloody stools. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.\n\n\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nPAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  from OMR notes\nIn [**8-/2159**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] biopsy of a right cheek skin\nlesion revealing lentigo maligna.  He [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a wide local\nexcision with a focal positive margin with no further resection\nat that time. In [**2161-9-9**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] abdominal US to\nevaluate abdominal pain which revealed small gallstones. There\nwere liver nodules noted consistent with hemangiomas. He\n[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a liver MRI on [**2162-3-11**], revealing a dominant liver\nnodule concerning for possible metastatic disease. Torso CT\nrevealed lung nodules.  On [**2162-3-18**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a brain MRI\nrevealing three brain lesions.  On [**2162-3-22**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a\nCT-guided liver biopsy confirming melanoma.  He was subsequently\nreferred to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a gamma\nknife evaluation.  He [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] gamma knife treatment to three\nbrain lesions on [**2162-4-9**] with brain MRI one month later\nrevealing stability. He began off protocol ipilimumab on\n[**2162-6-1**]. F/U brain MRI in early [**Month (only) 216**] showed several new small\nbrain lesions without associated edema. He had evidence of\nregression in SQ nodules at this time so he was observed. F/U\nbrain MRI revealed resolution of the largest CNS lesion with\ngrowth in some smaller lesions felt to be ipilimumab effect.\nTorso CT revealed continued improvement in systemic disease. He\n[**Month (only) 1834**] Gamma knife therapy to 5 lesions on [**2163-4-9**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].\nTorso CT was stable. He was admitted in [**2163-6-10**] twice at [**Hospital1 3278**]\nfor mental status changes responsive to steroids, presumably due\nto edema surrounding known metastatic disease.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Status post traumatic neck injury in [**2160**]\nafter falling off a ladder, status post C-spine fusion;\n2. history of chronic dysphagia from nutcracker esophagus\nsyndrome; 3. history of a frozen shoulder status post physical\ntherapy with\nimprovement in mobility\n4. history of lentigo maligna of the right cheek.\n5. Metastatic Melanoma as above\n\n\nSocial History:\nThe patient is married.  He is a nonsmoker.  He drinks rare ETOH\nand has no illicit drug use.  He worked as a painting contractor\nas well as real estate [**Doctor Last Name 360**].\n\n\nFamily History:\nno history of melanoma\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION EXAM\n\n98.1, HR 111, BP 135/80, RR 13, Sat 97%RA.

For example, an 8 x 10 mm left temporal lobe\nhyperattenuating lesion\nwith surrounding edema is unchanged (2A:16).  Left frontal 14 x\n8 mm lesion is\nalso stable (2A:21).  Bilobed focus of hyperattenuation in the\nleft\nfrontoparietal vertex is unchanged (2:23).  Surrounding edema is\nalso noted.\nThere is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.\n No new\nlesions detected on the CT exam.  Basal cisterns are patent.  No\nvascular\nterritorial infarction.  Sulci and ventricles are unchanged in\nsize and\nconfiguration.  Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells\nare well\naerated.  No fracture.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nIn comparison to [**2163-8-1**] CT exam, there is no significant\nchange in\nmultiple hyperdenselesions, compatible with metastatic disease,\nas described above. However, consider MR for better assessment.\n\nNOTE:\nA focus of increased density in the left frontal lobe anteriorly\nat the vertex ( se 2a, im 25)- ? artifact/real correlate with\nMRI for better assessment if not CI.\n\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.\n\n\nMRI BRACHIAL PLEXUS ([**2163-8-15**])\n1.  Progression of disease with significant increase in size of\nlung\nmetastases since [**2163-7-10**].  The largest lung metastasis is a\ncavitating\nlesion in the left upper lobe.  The known brain metastases were\nincompletely\nimaged at this time.\n\n2.  Edema within the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle\nbellies at their\nscapular origin - this is possibly secondary to myositis.\n\n3.  Unremarkable appearance of the brachial plexus.  Metallic\nhardware\nartifact along the right side of the lower cervical spine (C6-7)\nconsistent\nwith prior fixation.  Evaluation of cervical nerve roots would\nbe better\nassessed on the cervical MRI performed [**2163-8-3**].\n\nCXR ([**2163-8-14**])\n1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Known subcentimeter\npulmonary nodules\nnot well visualized.\n2.  Triangular opacity in peripheral left midlung likely\nartifact. Consider\nrepeat CXR to confirm.\n3.  Stable pectus excavatum deformity.\n\nCXR ([**2163-8-16**])\nSmall to moderate right pleural effusion is new, accompanying a\nlarge region of interstitial infiltration in the right lower\nlung, and growing\nheterogeneous opacification of the left suprahilar lung.\nAlthough there could be a component of pulmonary edema, it is\nlikely that there is bilateral pneumonia. A triangular opacity\nin the periphery of the left upper lobe, new on [**8-14**] and\nstill present is either infection or infarction. Fullness in\nboth hila and the paratracheal regions of the mediastinum could\nbe due to vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.\nCalcification of granulomatous lymph nodes is documented on the\n[**2163-7-12**] torso CT. Heart size is normal.\n\nEMG ([**2163-8-18**])\nFINDINGS:\nMotor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) of the right median nerve\ndemonstrated\nnormal distal latency, mildly reduced response amplitudes,\nnormal conduction\nvelocity, and normal F-minimum latency.\n\nMotor NCSs of the right ulnar nerve demonstrated normal distal\nlatency,\nmoderately reduced response amplitudes, normal conduction\nvelocity, and\nslightly prolonged F-minimum latency.\n\nSensory NCS of the right median nerve was normal. Sensory NCS of\nthe right\nulnar nerve was normal. Sensory NCS of the right radial nerve\nwas normal.\nSensory NCS of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve\nwas normal.\nSensory NCS of the left lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve\ndemonstrated\ndecreased response amplitude and normal conduction velocity.\n\nRepetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz demonstrated no abnormal\ndecrement.\n\nStimulation of the right ulnar nerve, recording ADM, pre- and\npost-10 seconds\nof maximal voluntary contraction demonstrated no post-exercise\nfacilitation.\n\nConcentric needle electromyography (EMG) of selected right upper\nextremity\nmuscles revealed short duration, polyphasic motor units, many of\nwhich were\nlow-amplitude but some of which were normal amplitude, with\nearly recruitment\nin deltoid, biceps, infraspinatus and first dorsal interosseous.\nEMG of\ndeltoid also revealed increased insertional activity in the form\nof occasional\npositive sharp waves.\n\nConcentric needle EMG of right tibialis anterior and vastus\nlateralis revealed\nshort duration, mostly low-amplitude (some normal amplitude),\npolyphasic motor\nunits with early recruitment.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nAbnormal study. There is electrophysiological evidence for a\ngeneralized\nmyopathy without associated denervating (\"inflammatory\")\nfeatures. The\nabsence of denervating features does not rule out an\ninflammatory myopathy\n(myositis), particularly in the setting of concomitant\nglucorticoid use.\n\nTHYROID ULTRASOUND [**2163-8-18**]\nFINDINGS:  The right thyroid lobe measures 1.5 x 1.9 x 4.5 cm\nand contains a\nwell-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic nodule measuring 0.3 x\n0.2 x 0.2 cm\nin the middle portion of the thyroid lobe.  The remainder of the\nthyroid gland\ndemonstrates homogeneous echogenicity and normal vascularity.\n\nThe left thyroid lobe measures 1.5 x 1.4 x 4.2 cm and\ndemonstrates homogeneous\nechogenicity and normal vascularity without thyroid nodules.\n\nNo lymphadenopathy is identified in the neck.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Small right thyroid lobe nodule most likely\nrepresents a colloid\ncyst. No lymphadenopathy in the neck\n\nCXR [**2163-8-19**]\nIMPRESSION:  Improving right pleural effusion.  Worsening\ninterstitial edema.\nIncrease in perihilar opacity likely due to vascular engorgement\nor lymph node\nenlargement.\n\nCT Chest [**2163-8-20**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Diffuse ground glass and solid nodular opacities with more\nconfluent\nopacity at the right lung base are new from [**2163-7-12**]. Two\nopacities have\ncentral cavitation. The findings are concerning for infection,\nincluding\nfungal, and septic emboli. While these may represent markedly\nincreased\nmelanoma metastases, reassessment after treatment for infection\nis\nrecommended.\n\n2.  Interlobular septal thickening at the right lung base is\nunchanged from\n[**2162-3-12**].\n\n3.  Small, nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nActive issues:\n\n# DKA:  Patient was noted to be insulin resistant on prior\nadmissions, this presentation is likely [**2-10**] increase in decadron\ndosing. Possible that infection played a role in increasing\ninsulin resistance.  Patient was started on insulin drip in the\nED, his anion gap decreased from 34 on admission to 17 by the\ntime he was on the floor.  He was started on D51/2NS and\nelectrolytes were monitored Q6H and replaced as needed.  His\nmental status improved within several hours of insulin therapy\nand he became responsive to questioning.\n\n# IDDM: His sugars were initally difficult to control in the\nICU.  [**Last Name (un) **] consult was placed.  Patient's sugars remained in\nthe 300s-400s while on 25U lantus and ISS.  His regimen was\nbeing uptitrated when he was transferred to the floor. On the\nfloor, blood sugars remained labile, and patient had several AM\nepisodes of hypoglycemia. At [**Last Name (un) **] recommendation, patient's\ninsulin titrated to 30U qAM and 25U qHS of Lantus, as well as\nQACHS sliding scale, with improved blood sugar control.\n\n# Neurological deterioration: this has been ongoing problem for\nwhich he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] as an outpatient.  LP was done,\nwhich did not show any results c/w infection.  Could be [**2-10**]\nprogressing metastatic disease (as shown on MRI [**2163-8-3**]) vs.\nmetabolic due to uncontrolled diabetes.  Patient was at baseline\nbefore being transferred to the floor.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] saw the patient\nin the ICU- he had suspicion that his recurrent AMS was\nsecondary to possible leptomeningeal spread and CNS infiltration\nof the melanoma.  No malignant cells were seen on LP [**8-5**] and\nMRI C spine revealed no malignant leptomeningeal disease.  A\nfinding of right arm weakness prompted MRI of the brachial plexi\nwhich were neurologically unremarkable, but reflected a\nworsening burden of pulmonary metastases.  EMG was done, which\nshowed diffuse myopathy with no definitive inflammatory\nfeatures. Steroid taper was begun while patient on the floor,\nwith no confusion or change in mental status. If steroid wean\nnot feasible, PCP prophylaxis will have to be started.\n\n# Pan-hypopituitarism:  TSH/T4/[**Last Name (un) **]/Prolactin/Testosterone were\nall found to be decreased during admission. Ddx includes\nautoimmune endocrinopathy from ipilimumab or post-radiation\npituitary damage.  Endocrinology was consulted. Patient was\nstarted on thyroid hormone replacement and testosterone\nreplacement. No mineralocorticoid replacement was indicated at\nthis time.\n\n# Dyspnea: Patient developed shortness of breath the evening of\n[**8-13**] with desaturations. He was also tachycardic to the 100-110s.\nHis CXR at that time reflected a possible multilobar pneumonia\nwhich was broadly covered as HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime.\nHis dyspnea improved, and by day of discharge he was satting\nwell on room air and had been afebrile for multiple days. Chest\nCT on [**8-20**] showed diffuse ground glass and solid nodular\nopacities with more confluent opacity at the right lung base,\nwith 2 lesions with central cavitation. These were felt to most\nlikely represent metastases, but infectious causes (including\nfungal or mycobacterial infectious) were also a significant\nconcern given patient's high dose steroid use. Blood cultures\nwere repeatedly negative, so septic emboli felt to be less\nlikely. Infectious disease was consulted and initial fungal\nstudies were sent. Additional workup, including serial AFB\nsputum cultures to rule out TB were recommended. However, the\npatient and his family felt very strongly about  going home.\nDespite being advised to stay and continue work-up, they chose\nto go home on levofloxacin on [**2163-8-21**].\n\n# METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEAD METASTASES: Patient with\nmetastatic melanoma currently being treated with off label\nipilimumab. MRI of brachial plexus and CT of chest showed\nprobable progression of metastatic burden in lungs.\n\nTransition issues:\n- recheck TFTs [**2163-8-25**] and adjust dose of thyroid hormone\n- Beta glucan, galactomannan, cryptococcal antigen, legionella\nantigen\n- sputum culture (including AFB) not done as inpatient;\nmycobacterial infection cannot be decisively ruled out\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

During your hospitalization,\nyou were found to have a pneumonia and treated with antibiotics.\nA chest CT [**2163-8-19**] showed new lung lesions. They may be related\nto your melanoma, but we cannot rule out infection as a cause\nincluding fungal or less likely myobacterial infection. Fungal\nlab studies were sent. We discussed that work-up of these\nlesions was not yet complete, and that further workup would\ninclude sputum testing to rule out tuberculosis. However, you\nand your family decided that it was important for you to go home\ntoday. Your outpatient oncology team will arrange for additional\ninfectious disease follow-up pending initial results.\n\nChanges to your medications include:\n- inject 30 units of insulin glargine (Lantus) subcutaneously in\nthe morning and 20 units of insulin glargine (Lantus)\nsubcutaneously at bedtime\n- inject Humalog subcutaneously with meals per sliding scale\n- take dexamethasone 4mg every 12 hours\n- apply one 4mg Androderm patch to your skin each day (and\nremove old patch)\n- start levofloxacin 750mg daily for 5 more days\n- start levothyroxine 88mcg daily\n- oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain\n- start docusate and senna as needed for constipation (because\noxycodone can cause constipation)\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization\nand we wish you all the best going forward.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou have a post-discharge appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Tan at\n[**Last Name (un) **].
