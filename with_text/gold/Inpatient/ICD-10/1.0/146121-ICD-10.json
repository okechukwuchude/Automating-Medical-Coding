There is no free air given\nlimitation of supine technique.\n\nRENAL SCAN Study Date of [**2153-6-15**]\nIMPRESSION: Differential renal function demonstrated with the\nleft kidney\nperforming 18% of total renal function and the right performing\n82%. There is a large renal pelvis on the right, but there is\nprompt washout from the pelvis after administration of lasix.\n\n\nINTRO CATH TO PELVIS FOR DRAINAGE AND INJ Study Date of [**2153-6-15**]\n6:23 PM\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Large stone in the left renal collecting system.\n2. Dilatation of the upper pole calices, containing pus.\n3. Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided left\nnephrostomy tube placement.\n\nPORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2153-6-16**] 5:11 AM\nABDOMEN, SUPINE AND UPRIGHT: Comparison is made to the two days\nearlier.\nA left-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube has been placed since\nthe prior\nstudy. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but a\nleading sidehole is likely within the distal esophagus.\nAdvancement of the tube by several centimeters would lead to\nmore optimal placement. There is moderate persistent distention\nof small bowel loops, little changed since both films from the\nprior day, and non-specific as to etiology.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**Date range (1) 30784**] - Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p left\npercutaneous nephrostomy due to high risk of hemodynamic\ninstability with active infection and markedly elevated WBC.  Pt\nwas recieved to the unit with stable vitals and no complaints.\nshe was placed on IV fluids and monitered.  There were no\novernight events, electrolytes were replaced and she was\ntransferred back to the floor with stable vital signs and\nimprovement in WBC.\n\n# Septicemia, Fungal UTI, Obstructing Renal Calculus,\nLeukocytosis\n- Cultures of the urine, including from the percutaneous\nnephrostomy tube have repeatedly grown yeast, and although never\nspeciated clinical there was impressive effect from diflucan,\nwith resolution of her leukocytosis. She had a brief stay in the\nICU, but rapidly improved. Initially in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started\non cefepime, vancomycin, mtronidazole and floconazole, but\nnothing other than yeast was ever isolated, so other than\ndiflucan these were stopped.\n- Urology was consulted and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was\ninserted. After insertion, the urology team was deciding between\na nephrectomy versus lithotripsy. Both of these would be high\nrisk in this patient. It was noted that the stone appears\nradiolucent on xray, so there is a thought this is a uric acid\nstone; the patient was started on bicitra to dissolve the stone.\nThe plan is 6 weeks of bictra then followup CT, with plan that\nif stone is dissolving then continue current therapy, but if\nnot, then patient will require intervention, likely lithotripsy.\n\n# Acute Renal Failure on CKD Stage III:\n- This is likely multifactorial given her obstructing renal\ncalculus. It improved with the nephrostomy and hydration. At\ntime of discharge she was at her baseline.\n- Given decision of what to do with the stone, a renal scan was\nperformed as above.\n\n# Metabolic Acidosis: in setting of ARF\n- IV hydration with bicarb drip with resolution in ICU\n\n# Hypoxemia: developed mild O2 requirement while on floor (was\nalso getting IVF). Reports of hypoxia at rehab, this had\nresolved by time of discharge and was likely due to septicemia.\n\n# Seizure disorder:\n- cont topiramate 50 [**Hospital1 **]\n- cont neurontin for now (Neurontin may also be contributing to\nher lethargy in the setting of ARF), however this can be\naddressed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 1501**].\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Continued amiodarone 200, (deemed not a\ncandidate for coumadin in past, not on ASA given vaginal\nbleed/epistaxis).

We are trying to dissolve the stone with a\nmedication. This medication can affect your electrolytes, so\nwill need to be closely monitored.\n\nYou will need a cat scan in 6 weeks to assess.\n\nYou need to eat carefully, as you have a high-risk of aspirating\nfood into your lung which can cause pneumonia.\n\nYou are going on a medication called Fluconazole which is an\nantibiotic to treat the infection you had in the kidney. You\nmust complete the course of this medication.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nProvider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D. Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**]\nDate/Time:[**2153-9-11**] 10:30\n\nCT Scan Pelvis with/without contrast in 6 weeks with results to\nurology\n\n\n"
