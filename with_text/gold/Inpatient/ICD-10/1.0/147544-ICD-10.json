A small secundum atrial\nseptal defect is present. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion\nis normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\nare normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic\naorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely\nthickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis\n(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nPossible cleft in the posterior mitral leaflet. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.\nBioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Valve appears\nwell seated and the leaflets move well. Mild mitral\nregurgitation persists.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**2161-11-18**] he was brought to\nthe operating room where he underwent an aortic valve\nreplacement via a minimally invasive approach.
