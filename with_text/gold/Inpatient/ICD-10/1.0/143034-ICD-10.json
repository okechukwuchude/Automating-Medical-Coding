Differential\ndiagnosis includes seizure, syncope, infection, intracranial\nmass.  Description of episode, LOC without immediate recovery is\nmore consistent with seizure than syncope.  Pertinent negatives\ninclude normal CSF, CT scan unchanged without any acute bleed or\nmidline shift. Episode seems less likely to be syncope given\nassociation with headache, however she was placed on telemetry.\nNo events were found.  She had orthostatics which showed an\n18mmg difference between systolic blood pressures standing and\nsitting, and was given a fluid bolus of 1L.  EEG for 20 minute\nshowed short runs of sharp waves concerning for seizure\nactivity, and so 24-hour EEG was recommended.  Urine and blood\ncultures were sent. The 24 hour EEG study was undertaken and no\nseizure activity was noted.  Patient denied any seizure activity\nor loss of consciousness.  She was started on valproic Acid to\nprevent further seizures which she will take once discharged.\n\n(2) Headache:  Patient with 1-2 months of headaches that are\nincreasing in frequency and now associated with loss of\nconsciousness and vomiting.  Etiology unclear.  Differential\nincludes metastatic disease, migraine, tension, post LP,\nmedication side effect.  Patient has a history of migraine\nheadaches prior to diagnosis of breast cancer.  CT scan ruled\nout acute bleed or midline shift.  CSF with no evidence of\ninfection. She was started on morphine 2-5 mg q 4hrs prn pain\nwith continuation of gabapentin prn and cyclobenzaprine as\nneeded.  Pain service was consulted who recommended no blood\npatch as was considered a possibility as an outpatient.  They\ndid recommend IV caffeine, however, this is not available\ncurrently, as well as continuing morphine and encouraging good\nfluid intake, which minimalization of position changes.  Pt was\ntransitioned from Morphine IV to Morphine Sulfate IR 15-30 mg PO\nQ4H in preparation for discharge. This oral morphine seemed to\ncontrol her pain well and pt was satisfied with pain control\nregimen.\n\n(3) Leukocytosis:  Patient received neulasta [**8-8**]. Likely\nsecondary to this.  No evidence of infection (unchanged chest\nX-ray, normal CSF, normal urinalysis, denies fever, chills, or\nnightsweat).  Patient's oncologist informed who believes this is\nmost likely secondary to Neulasta and dexamethasone.  This was\ntrended.\n\n(4) Metastatic Breast Cancer:  Patient is s/p lumpectomy with\nchemo and radiation therapy.  Metastatic disease to lung, [**Month/Year (2) 500**],\nbrain, leptomeningeal disease.  Current chemo regimen includes\nintrathecal cytarabine, zoledronic acid, paclitaxel,\nbevacixumab.  Outpatient oncologist was informed.  Dexamethasone\ntaper from CyberKnife to cerebellar lesions was continued; this\nshould be 2mg [**2105-8-12**], 1mg [**2105-8-13**], 0.5mg [**2105-8-14**], then stop.\n Chemotherapeutic regimen was held while hospitalized which she\nwill resume as directed by primary oncologist.\n\n(5) CAD s/p MI with Stent:\n- continued ASA, crestor\n- Plavix on hold for possible blood patch, this was restarted as\nthe pain service does not want to pursue a blood patch.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.
