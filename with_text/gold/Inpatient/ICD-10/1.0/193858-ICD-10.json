He was last known to be well\nat 6pm this evening.  At 6:30 pm, the patient's roommate was\nunable to arouse him from couch initially.  He apparently then\ndid arouse with slurred speech, although this may have been due\nto missing dentures.  He was found to be confused, weak and\nunable to stand, with a blood sugar of 100.  The ambulance was\ncalled and he developed worsening confusion/mental status while\nen route to the ED and was on a face mask on arrival.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: Tmax 99.2 P 68 BP 210/99 R 21 O2 sat\n99% NRB. Patient was altered but following commands during code\nstroke (neuro consulted, tPA not given). He was intubated for\nairway protection, propofol for sedation.  After intubation, OG\ntube placement yielded 500mL of dark bloody fluid that clear\nwith 250mL of NS lavage. He had guaiac positive brown stool.  He\nreceived Protonix 80mg IV x1, 40mEq of potassium and had 2\nperipheral IVs placed through which he received 1L NS. Transfer\nVS: 52 180/82 14 100% on vent settings below.\n.\nOn the floor, the patient arrives intubated and sedated,\nresponding only to sternal rub.\n.\nReview of systems:  Unable to obtain\n\nPast Medical History:\nCHF\nAtrial Fibrillation\nCOPD\nHypertension\nSchizophrenia\nDJD\nOsteoporosis\nBack pain\ns/p Discectomy\nBPH\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives in nursing home since [**2095**], unable to obtain further\nhistory\n\n\nFamily History:\nunable to obtain\n\nPhysical Exam:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL\nVitals: T: 96.2 BP: 183/74 P: 55 R: 500x14 50% FiO2 PEEP 6, Sat\n100%\nGeneral: Intubated, sedated, responds to vigorous sternal rub\nHEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, pupils\nconstricted, minimally responsive but equal/bilateral\nNeck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD\nLungs: Anterior/lateral clear to auscultation, no rhonchi or\ncrackles\nCV: Slow, regular rate, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,\ngallops\nAbdomen: soft, non-tender, obese, bowel sounds present\nGU: foley in place\nRectal: No blood in rectal vault\nExt: RLE trace edema, 2+ pulses\n\nDISCHARGE PHYSICAL\nVitals: T: 97.1 BP: 112/64 P: 89 R: 18 Sat 100% RA\nGeneral: alert, awake, interactive\nHEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL\nNeck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD\nLungs: CTAB, minimal bronchiole sounds in RLL\nCV: Slow, regular rate, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,\ngallops\nAbdomen: + bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended\nExt: wwp, 2+ DP\nNeuro: Alert and oriented x 3, CN 2- 12 intact, able to ambulate\nwith walker\n\nPertinent Results:\nImaging/diagnostics:\n1. CT head w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial\nabnormalities.\n2. EEG: This is an abnormal VEEG telemetry due to the presence\nof a\ngeneralized slow background rhythm of [**3-10**] Hz, with frequent\nperiods of\n[**5-12**] theta activity, indicative of severe diffuse cerebral\ndysfunction.\nThis tracing is etiologically non-specific but indicative of\ndiffuse\nencephalopathy such as metabolic disturbance, infection, or\nmedication\neffect. There are no focal abnormalities or epileptiform\nfeatures\nnoted. Compared to prior EEG recordings, this EEG is unchanged.\n3. CXR: Right middle lobe collapse. Adjacent right lower lobe\nopacity could also be due to atelectasis, but appearance and\nclinical symptoms raise concern for pneumonia. The terminal tip\nof the left PICC line is positioned at the cavoatrial junction.\n4. Video swallow test ([**2101-8-19**]): Aspiration with all liquid\nconsistencies with oropharyngeal residue after swallow.\n5. Video swallow test ([**2101-8-23**]): No aspiration or penetration is\nseen with multiple consistencies of barium. Normal swallowing\nmechanics are demonstrated.

There was concern for poor airway protection, so\nhe was intubated. EEG and CT head were obtained to rule out\nintracranial bleed and seizure, which were negative. Metobolic\nworkup was all negative. Blood cultures were negative. He was\nextubated and transferred to the floor.\n.\n2) Pneumonia: On arrival, patient was found to have clinical\nsigns of penumonia including fever, sputum production, and\ncough. CXR showed RLL pneumonia, so patient was started\nempirically on vancomycin + aztreonem + levofloxacin + flagyl\nfor  ventilator-associated pneumonia. Sputum culture showed H.\ninfluenza and beta Streptococci, thus he was narrowed to\nlevofloxain, and completed a 7day course prior to discharge.\n.\n3) Aspiration: Initial video speech and swallow exam on the\nfloor showed aspiration of liquids. An dobhoff tube was placed\ntemporarily for feeding. Repeat video swallow showed no more\naspiration and patient was placed on thin liquid with crushed\nsolid diet.\n.\n3) Upper GI Bleed: On admission, NG lavage was positive for\nblood. Aspirin was held and patient placed on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. On the\nfloor, patient remained HD stable. He refused an EGD and after\ndiscussion with his legal guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 108882**], the decision was\nmade to perform the EGD as an outpatient.  Resuming aspirin\nshould be reconsidered as outpt after Hct has been stable for\nseveral weeks.\n.\n4) Skin blisters on left back: There was concern for shinles at\nfirst, thus DFA, viral cultures, and HSZ/VZV serologies were\nsent, which came negative. Would care was provided and the rash\nimproved without further treatment.\n.\n4) CHF/Afib/Hypertension: No evidence of heart failure. He was\nkept on his home medications ACE-I, metoprolol, and digoxin upon\ntransfer to the floor.\n.\n5) Schizophrenia: Continue Zyprexa 7.5mg PO QHS\n.\n6) Depression/Anxiety: Continue Paroxetine\n.\n7) Osteoporosis: Continue alendronate upon arrival on the floor\n\nMedications on Admission:\nASA 325mg PO Daily\nIbuprofen 600mg PO QAM\nMetoprolol 50mg PO Daily\nDigoxin 0.125mcg PO daily\nLisinopril 30mg PO daily\nAlbuterol INH PRN\nIpratropium/Albuterol Nebs PRN\nBudesonide 1 Puff PO Daily\nZyprexa 7.5mg PO QHS\nGabapentin 300mg PO BID\nParoxetine 20mg PO daily\nTylenol 1g PO BID\nAlendronate 70mg PO QSaturday\nOxybutynin 5mg PO daily (to end [**9-/2101**])\nVitamin D 400 IU PO BID\nCalcium 500mg PO TID\nThiamine 100mg PO Daily\nFolic 1mg PO Daily\nMultivitamin 1 tab PO Daily\nColace 100mg PO QAM\nSenna PRN\nMilk of Mag PRN\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We were worried that\nyou were having a stroke so when you got the hospital, we got a\nCT scan of your head which did no show any signs of bleeding.\nThe neurologists also did an EEG exam to make sure you were not\nhaving a seizure. You were not. Because your mental status was\naltered, we were worried you would not be able to breath\nproperly on your own so we put a breathing tube down to help you\nbreath. We also realized that you had blood in your stomach, and\nwe were concerned you might be bleeding because of an ulcer. We\nwanted to put a scope down your throat to examine your stomach\nbut you refused. We talked to your legal guardian who agreed\nthat the scoping can happen after you leave the hospital as long\nas you were not actively bleeding. You developed a rash on your\nback which we at first thought might be due to shingles, but\nafter doing some tests decided it was not. We protected your\nskin and performed regular wound care. After a few days we were\nable to take the breathing tube out and you began to breath well\non your own with a little bit of supplemental oxygen. You were\ntransferred from the intensive care unit to the regular medical\nfloor. There, we found that you had a pneumonia, most likely\nbecause you were aspirating fluids into your lung. We gave you\nantibiotics to treat the pneumonia and you got much better. We\nfound out that you had an infection in your stomach by a\nbacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can lead to stomach\nulcers and cause bleeding. We started you on antibiotics to\ntreat that. We also asked the speech and swallow doctors to [**Name5 (PTitle) 788**]\n[**Name5 (PTitle) **] who saw that you were aspirating food into your lungs. So we\nput a small tube through your nose into your stomach and gave\nyou nutrition that way. After two days, you gained your strength\nand the speech and swallow doctors decided that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were no\nlonger aspirating food. You also worked with physical therapists\nto gain your strength. At the time of discharge, you were able\nto move around with your walker on your own.\n\nWe ADDED the following medications:\n1. Clarithromycin 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours UNTIL [**2101-9-4**]\n2. Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth, three times a day UNTIL\n[**2101-9-4**]\n3. Omeprazole 40 mg PO by mouth every 12 hours\n\nWe STOPPED the following medications:\n1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth per day --> given your recent GI\nbleed, please discuss with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) 5001**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11370**]g.\n2. Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth in the morning\n3. Gabapentin 300 mg by mouth twice a day\n4. Budesonide 1 puff by mouth daily\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: DIV.
