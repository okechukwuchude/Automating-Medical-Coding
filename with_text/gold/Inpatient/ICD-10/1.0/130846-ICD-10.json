She was emergently taken to the angio suite and her\nimages were uploaded and reviewed.  She underwent:\n1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of bilateral common femoral\n    arteries.\n2. Bilateral introduction of catheter into aorta.\n3. Abdominal aortogram and selective iliac arteriogram.\n4. Endovascular stent graft exclusion of ruptured abdominal\n    aortic aneurysm with a [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 31 x 14-1/2 x 130 main body\n    endo prosthesis and right [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 20 x 9.5 iliac limb and\n    [**Doctor Last Name 4726**] 14-1/2 x 7 left iliac extension limb.\n5. Perclose closure of bilateral common femoral\n    arteriotomies.\n6. Left common femoral endarterectomy with vein patch\n    angioplasty.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  Of note, she was not\nintubated for the procedure given her age and co-morbidities.\n\nNeuro: no active issues, patient is alert and interactive\n\nCardiopulmonary: Post-operatively she was closely monitored in\nthe CVICU. Initally her PPM was pacing her appropriately,\nhowever, overnight she had an episode of asystole, lasting less\nthan 30 seconds. Compression were started, and the pt almost\nimmediately began pacing appropriately again. These episodes\nrecurred a few more times the evening of POD 0 and\nelectrophysiology was urgently consulted.  The EP fellow\ninterrogated the device and found the RV lead to be dislodged.\nHe adjusted the settings, and the pacer functioned properly.  He\nrecommended repleting electrolytes and discontinuing digoxin as\nwell.  These interventions resolved her arrythmias.  On [**6-16**]\nthe patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular\nresponse and required IV lopressor and then a diltiazem drip for\nrate control.  EP and cardiology were asked to advise on\ntreatment.  Soltalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem 30mg qid were\nstarted and the diltiazem gtt weaned off. The pt returned to a\npaced sinus rhythm within 24hrs of the atrial fibrillation and\nhad no further episodes throughout her stay.  Anticoagulation\nwas initally recommended, however given the pts age and\ncomorbidities it was decided that heparin/coumadin benefit would\nnot outway the risk, and thus asprin 325mg was initiated. On the\nmorning of [**6-16**] the patient began to c/o SOB, required increased\nO2 and was hypoxemic on her ABG. There was concern for CHF\nexacerbation as well as PE.  She urgently underwent CTA which\nruled out pulmonary embolism.  The CT did reveal pulmonary edema\nand bilateral pleural effusions.  Interventional pulmonology was\nconsulted and felt these effusions were not large enough to\ndrain. There was some concern the pt may have developed\npneumonia as well given her previous emesis and immobility.  The\npatient was put on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and put on\na fluid restriction and aggressively diuresed with lasix over\nthe next several days with close monitoring and repletion of her\nelectrolytes.  The diureses significantly improved her symptoms\nand her O2 requirements were subsequently minimal. On [**6-22**] she\nwas thought to be quite stable from a medical and surgical\nstandpoint and EP took her to the procedure lab where they\nexchanged her PPM for a new device.  She tolerated the procedure\nwell and her.\n\nGI/Nutrition:  The patient vomitted twice on POD 0 during chest\ncompressions, after which an  NG tube placed.  The tube was\nremoved a few days later when her bowel function returned.\nSpeech and swallow was consulted to evaluate for aspiration risk\nprior to advancing the patients diet.  On preliminary\nexamination she passed her swallow evaluation and she was\nstarted on a ground puree diet which was later advanced to\nregular diet with thin liquids which she tolerated well.\n\nGU: patient was found to have a UTI on Urinalysis and she was\nstarted on antibiotics.  The culture grew moderate amt of\npseudomonas and she was started on cirpo. Her foley was\nexchanged.  It was not removed as she was being aggressively\ndiuresed and her I/O's required close monitoring. A second UA/Cx\nwas sent on [**6-22**] and was negative with no bacterial growth. At\nthe time of discharge her foley was removed and she was voiding\nwithout difficulty.\n\nID: Post-operatively patient received 3 days of kefzol for\nperioperative coverage.  Given her UTI, she was started on\nciprofloxacin on [**2122-6-16**], but this was switched to ceftriaxone\nand doxyclycline given concern for PNA after episodes of\nvomitting and consolidation seen on CXR and CT.\n\nHeme: patient received SQH throughout her stay for dvt\nprophylaxis. There was concern for a DVT in her RUE and RLE\nduring her stay, however both were ruled out. She did work with\nphysical therapy but given her deconditioned state only\nambulated minimally. She is discharged on SQH to continue at\nrehabilitation facility until she is ambulating at her baseline\nstate.\n\nMedications on Admission:\npotassium 20 meq daily\nlasix 40 mg po qd\ndigoxin .125 mg daily\ncardizem ER 240 mg po qd\nASA 81 mg po qd\nmiralax\nclonidine 0.1 mg po bid\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
