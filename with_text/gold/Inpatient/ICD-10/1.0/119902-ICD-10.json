She had been feeling well until overnight she\ndeveloped s/o CP, without diaphoresis, nausea, radiation or\ndyspnea. Believing it was dyspepsia, the patient waited until\nmorning before calling EMS. An EKG was significant for SR w/ 1st\ndegree atrioventricular block and poor R wave progression which\nwas different from prior.  Vitals were 102/60, 72. She\nultimately ruled in for an NSTEMI with Troponin I 14.96 this\nmorning, given aspirin 325mg, loaded with plavix, started on\nheparin gtt and nitro paste and kept NPO. She was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, chest pain free.\nIncidentally, a foley catheter had been placed for urinary\nretention prior to transfer.\n.\nCardiac catheterization showed twin LAD systems with severe\nstenosis. Distal LAD stenosis also observed but not intervened\non. PCI was done to true LAD with Promus DES placed, initially\nresulting in severe non-reflow X 3 minutes. The flow gradually\nimproved with administration of adenosine, diltiazem and\nnicardipine. Right femoral arterial manual pull was performed.\nSome ST elevations were noted transiently during cardiac\ncatheterization. Plan is for return to cath lab for stenting of\nher right coronary artery in ~two weeks.\n.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n(+) chronic peripheral edema, hearing loss, rhinorrhea,\nnocturia, fatigue\n(-) orthopnea, PND, dyspnea, palpitations, stroke, bleeding\ndisorder\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system\ndemonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had 30%\ndistal stenosis.  The LAD had 90% mid-vessel stenosis.  The\ndistal LAD was diffusely diseased and occluded at the apex.\nThere was in intramyocardial large spetal with 90% origin\nstenosis.  The LCx had 60% stenosis at mid-segment with 80% OM1\ndisease.  The RCA had 80% stenosis in the distal segment with\n60% stenosis of the RPL.\n2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided\nfilling pressure with an LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was systemic\nsystolic arterial hypertension with an SBP of 158 mmHg.  There\nwas no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the LV\nto the Aorta.\n.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.  Poor targets for\nbypass in the\nleft coronary system.\n2. Left ventricular diastolic heart failure.\n3. Systemic systolic arterial hypertension.\n.\nTTE [**2110-4-5**]:\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction with mid to distal antero-septal, anterior\nand apical akinesis. The right ventricular cavity is mildly\ndilated with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending\naorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are\nmildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate\n([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nHOSPITAL COURSE\n88 year old woman with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, GERD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on\ncoumadin and sotalol who was admitted to the CCU status post DES\nto LAD for post catheter monitoring after three minutes of\nsevere non-reflow to LAD observed during cath. Plan for staged\nintevention of septal LAD and RCA lesions in several weeks.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient is status post DES to\nLAD with plan for staged intervention to septal LAD and RCA in\nseveral weeks.  Admitted to CCU for monitoring after 3 minutes\nof severe non reflow that was relieved with adenosine, diltiazem\nand nicardipine. Cardiac risk factors include dyslipidemia,\ndiabetes and hypertension with a reported postive stress test in\n[**2106**]. She was started on full dose aspirin and plavix. Home dose\nof lisinopril held post cath and started the following day. She\nwas started on atorvastatin 80mg daily. Lipid panel showed LDL\n88, and A1c was 8.4. TTE demonstrated EF 40%, mild to moderate\nregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to\ndistal antero-septal, anterior and apical akinesis.\n.\n# RHYTHM/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  History of atrial fibrillation on\ncoumadin at home. Now in sinus rhythm.  Now status post DES to\nLAD, the patient will require plavix and aspirin for one year.\nDecision made to discontinue coumadin in setting of sinus rhythm\non admission and significant risk of bleeding if on triple\ntherapy. CHADS2 score is 3 (age, hypertension, diabetes). She\nwas continued on sotalol at her home dose.\n.\n# TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: History of DM2 on glyburide and\nmetformin.  Most recent known A1c from [**2099**] and 6.5.  Oral\ndiabetic agents in setting of cath and restarted 48 hours post\ncatheterization on discharge. Gluocose control managemed with\ninsulin sliding scale. A1c was 8.4.\n.\n# HYPERTENSION: History of labile pressures in the past with\nimproved control while on lisinopril, spironolactone, sotalol\nregimen. Spironolactone and lisinopril held in setting of\ncatherization and restarted the following morning. Imdur was\nheld given prn dosing at home and was stopped at discharge.\n.\n# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: History of hyperlipidemia on low dose lipitor\nat home. Unknown recent lipid panel.  She was started on\natorvastatin 80mg daily. As above, her LDL was 88. Her TSH was\n3.5.\n.\n# SPINAL STENOSIS: Currently on celebrex for pain management.\nHeld during admission given increased risk of adverse\ncardiovascular events and side effect of hypertension.  In\nfuture, if restart, note to important to co-administer w/\naspirin for mitigating effect.\n.\n# URINARY RETENTION: Episode of urinary retention occurred at\nOSH with placement of foley catheter and drainage of 700 cc\nfluid.  Urinalysis consistent with uncomplicated urinary tract\ninfection as symptom onset occurred before foley cath placement.\nShe was started on ciprofloxacin for total 3 day course.\nUrine culture showed gram negative rods.\n.\n# HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Isolated hyperbilirubinemia on admission\nin absence of right upper quadrant tenderness. Fractionated\nbilirubin demonstrated t. bili 2.0 and direct bili 0.5 which\ntrended down to normal without intervention.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHOME MEDICATIONS:\n1.
