Neurological exam shows unequal, reactive pupils\n(L>R) but otherwise, nonfocal exam. Noncontrast head ct showed a\n3 cm left temporal bleed with mild surrounding vasogenic edema\nand localized mass effect, but no midline shift and basal\ncisterns intact. Etiology for bleed unlikely to be hypertensive\ngiven location and only mildly elevated BP at OSH. Underlying\nstructural lesion is possible, especially since there appears to\nbe prominent vasculature on CTA. Venous thrombosis was also\nconsidered.\n.\n#Left Temporoparietal Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient\nunderwent and MRI/MRV to further delineate an underlying\nmass/lession (see full report above). There was no evidence of\nvenous sinus thrombosis or mass, and the previously identified\nbleed was deemed stable. Our colleagues in Neurosurgery were\nconsulted and a cerebral angiogram was performed but did not\nidentify any pertinent vascular abnormalities. The patient due\nto initial presentation of seizure (likely secondary to\ntemporoparietal bleed) was placed on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] without\nany notable seizure events. He will continue this as an\noutpatient. The patient had his stroke risk factors evaluated,\nHBA1c WNL, and LDL of 136. He did not require starting of a\nstatin as this has been shown to increase the risk of bleeding.\nThe patient did have noticeable memory deficits on cognitive\nevaluation with occupational therapy. It has been recommended to\nthe patient to schedule an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\n(behavioral Neurology) in order to receive a full cognitive\nevaluation prior to returning to work. As to the etiology of the\nstroke, it is possible that is HTN related although the location\nis not necessarily specific for this. Patient will have a follow\nup MRI in about one month, and follow-up with Neurosurgery and\nNeurology to help delineate if there is another underlying\nlesion that was not identified on current studies.\n\n#ETOH: Per report from wife patient had been drinking up to 18\nbeers/day. Patient was placed on CIWA while in the unit and\nreceived only minimal doses. He clinically did not go into\nwithdrawl. The CIWA was kept upon transfer to the floor but he\ndid not require any BZD's. LFT's were WNL, with no transminitis,\nand liver synthetic function was normal. Patient was given\nthiamine, folic acid, and multivitamin while in the hospital.\n\n#HTN: Patient initially had goal SBP<160 with PRN hydralazine.\nHe was on lotrel (5 amlodipine, 40 benezepril) at home. He had\nthis restarted upon arrival to the floor and acheived good\ncontrol with this. He will continue his home Lotrel as he\nreceived\n\n#Tobacco Use: Patient has been a lifelong smoker. We discussed\nthat this was a risk factor for stroke. He was given a nicotine\npatch while in hospital. He will discuss cessation options\n(including welbutrin or chantix) with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was given\na prescription for nicotine patches.\n\n# Social issues: The patient's wife was uncomfortable coping\nbefore baseling and more worried after her husband's stroke.\nSocial work was consulted and helped provide resources to Mr.\n[**Known lastname 110267**] regarding alcohol cessation, in addition the patient's\nwife was given support resources as well.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1) Continue Keppra until follow up with Neurology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\n2) Repeat MRI in about 1 month, f/u with Nsurg\n3) Continued monitoring of blood pressure control per PCP\n4) Discussion of continued tobacco cessation with PCP\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLotrel (almodipine 5, benzepril 40)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. amlodipine-benazepril 5-40 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO\nonce a day.\n3. nicotine 14 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) Patch 24 hr\nTransdermal DAILY (Daily) as needed for nicotine withdrawal:\napply when you feel the craving for cigarette.

You were sent to\nthe hospital after having had a seizure and a terrible headache.\nYou were admitted to the Neurology service, and a scan was\nperformed of your head that showed a bleed in the left side of\nyour brain. While it is still unclear exactly what caused the\nbleed, the most likely cause is your high blood pressure. You\nhad a study of your blood vessels of the brain which was\nreassuring, but did not help to reveal a potential cause for the\nbleed in your brain.\n\nYour seizure that you had was most likely due to the bleed in\nthe brain. For this reason we are starting you on an\nanti-seizure medication known as Keppra. You will need to\ncontinue this until your follow up with the Neurology team (Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see below for your scheduled appointment.\n\nBecause you had a seizure, it will be important that you DO NOT\ndrive for the next 6 months. In addition to this please avoid\ndangerous activities such as climbing. Also, do not take baths\nor swim as you are at an increased risk for drowning if you were\nto have a seizure.\n\nIn addition, we discussed with you the risk factors for your\nbleed in the brain. There are several things you can do to\nreduce your risk of stroke. You should continue to take your\nblood pressure medication,  and reduce your sodium intake to\nhelp control your blood pressure. In addition, smoking is a\nlarge risk factor for having a stroke, and if you were to quit\nit would greatly reduce your risk. For this reason we are\npresribing you a patch known as the nicotine patch to help you\nfight off the craving. DO NOT smoke while you have the nicotine\npatch in place. There are other medications as well that can be\nused to help you quit smoking (bupropion and welbutrin), you\nshould discuss this with your primary care provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **],\nsometimes heavy drinking of alcohol can cause problems with your\nblood clotting. The Social Work team has provided you options\nabout certain programs that can help you with your alcohol\nintake.\n\nSocial work has also provided you with information on programs\nto help with your alcohol use, in addition, for your wife to\nhave support as well.\n\nAlso, due to the location of your bleed you were noted to have\nissues associated with your memory. You were seen by\nOccupational Therapy who has recommended a full neurocognitive\nevaluation before you return to work. Please call to setup an\nappointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the contact information\nwill be provided below.\n\nAlso, the Neurosurgery team would like for you to follow-up and\nget a repeat scan of your head in a month. Please see below.\n\nWe made the following changes to your medications:\nSTART Keppra 1000mg take one tablet by mouth twice daily\n(continue to take this until your follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\nSTART Tylenol (Acetaminophen) take one to two 500mg tablets\nevery 8 hours as needed for headache\nSTART Nicotine Patch (transdermal) 14mg apply once every 24\nhours as needed for cigarette craving\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou will need to follow-up with your primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\n[**12-2**] weeks. Please call Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Monday [**3-23**] to\nsetup an appointment. You should discuss your smoking cessation\nand your blood pressure medication. The phone number is\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 39454**].\n\nYou need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery in 1\nmonth. You will need an MRI/MRA prior to this appt. Appt can be\nmade by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**].\n\nYou will need a formal neuro-cogntive evaluation to evaluate for\nyour safety to return to work.
