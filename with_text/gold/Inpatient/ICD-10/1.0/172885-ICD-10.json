Course\ncomplicated by Portal Vein Thrombosis, Cholelithiasis with\nlikely choledocholithiasis, transudative pulmonary effusion s/p\ntap, concern for DIC physiology (though thought unlikely given\nlab derrangements in context of cirrhosis), as well as\nhypercalcemia. Pt had ERCP on [**11-30**]. The stone as removed and a\nfilter was placed, but bilirubin remained high (50s). Sadly, the\npatient expired on [**2124-12-9**]. A brief review of the hospital\ncourse is presented belowd\n.\n.\n.\n#Altered mental status: Patient demonstrates marked rise in\nTBili on presentation (38.5 -->53.1-->48.0), bumping hepatic\nencephalopathy to top of differential. Other potential causes:\nMS changes [**12-25**] fungemia given reported fungal derm infection,\nbleed (but no recent trauma), mass effect or lyphomatous spread\nto the meninges, drugs (denies drug use). Low suspicion for\nmeningitis or infection with white count at 5.4, afebrile. LP on\nprevious admission for same presentation was negative and so do\nnot feel need to repeat at this time. There are case reports of\nneoplastic syndromes secondary to CNS lymphoma (including in\nthis hospital), but these are diagnosed by brain biopsy and\nexclusion. Hepatic encephalopathy worsened until patient's\nultimate demise.\n.\n.\n#Hyperbilirubinemia: Unresolving circa 50. Of note, CT Abd\nreveals 8MM stone noted in CBD and ductual dilitation, but no\nimprovement s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**11-30**]. In addition,\nCT abd reveals no evidence of flow through portal vein in\ncontrast to [**7-31**] study at which time flow was still\nvisualized. Finally, labs further described below concerning for\nDIC (though subsequent factor assays--Factro VIII at 172 and ten\nand 7 93 and 16, respectively, suggest otherwise). Hence, causes\nmay be multi-factorial. Lacutlose and Rifaximin given good\nresults with these medication on last admission with same\npresentation.\n\n.\n.\nEffusion: Patient's original R sided effusion tapped on [**11-25**]. Approx 2L removed. Labs not consistent with empyema. CT\nChest s/p tap on [**11-28**] shows moderate Right pulmoary effusion with\nunderlying consolidation/collapse of RLL (4mm nodule is unchaged\nfrom before and requires follow-up as outpatient). Pt has\noccasionally needed 02 to keep saturations above 92%. Lung exam\nslowly resolving. Fluid analysis transudative, non-infectious\nthus far. No apparent underlying organizing process on CT, but\nmoderate right pleural effusion with underlying\nconsolidation/collapse of the right lower lobe noted immediately\nafter tap. Repeat CXR with complete re-filling of right lung.\nPatient's respiratory status appeared comfortable throughout the\nhospitalization through until his death.\n.\n#Fungal infection:  Histopath showed hyphal elements in the\ninflammatory component and deeper skin structures. Cultures\npositive for \"fungus\" from end of [**Month (only) 1096**]. ID was involved from\nthe onset and antibiotics were selected and titated according to\nrecommendations, but the patient passed away before clear\nresults could be identified.\n\n.\n\n# FEN: low sodium diet. replete lytes prn\n.\n# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen\n.\n# Code: DNR DNI\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAlbuterol 90 mcg, Cipro 250', Lactulose 60'''', MgOxide, Nadolol\n20',\nNystatin, Pantoprazole 40',Rifaximin 400''', Spironolactone\n200',\nTestosterone 1 % (25 mg/2.5 g) Gel 2.5 grams Transdermal daily\nVitamin D3 400 units daily, Glargine 8 units qHS, Ursodiol\n300'''\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nLiver Failure [**12-25**] Hep C\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNA\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nNA\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2125-3-9**]"
