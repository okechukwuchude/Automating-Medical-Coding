Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve\nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary\nartery systolic pressure is normal. There is a\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved\nglobal and regional biventricular systolic function. No valvular\npathology or pathologic flow identified.\n\n- Carotid U/S:\n1. No significant right ICA stenosis.\n2. 60-69% left ICA stenosis\n\n- ECHO [**2110-10-7**]\nPRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous\necho contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left\natrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right\natrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen\nby 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are\nnormal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is\nmild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). The\nright ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There\nare complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the\nresults in the operating room at the time of the study.\nPOST BYPASS The patient is a-paced. There is normal\nbiventricular systolic function (LVEF = 55%). No significant\nchange in valvular function. The thoracic aorta is intact s/p\ndecannulation.\n\n CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2110-10-14**] 3:27 PM\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old man s/p CABG\nFinal Report\nPA AND LATERAL VIEWS, CHEST: Small bilateral pleural effusions\nand bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged since yesterday,\nhowever, improved since multiple prior radiographs. There is no\npulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.\nPost-CABG appearance of the mediastinum is also unchanged. No\npneumothorax is present.\nIMPRESSION: No significant changes with mild basilar atelectasis\nand trace\npleural effusions.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n62 year old male was admitted on [**2110-10-3**] for cardiac\ncatheterization. He was found to have 2-vessel-disease and\ncritical left main disease on cardiac catheterization.\nSubsequently, he underwent pre-op evaluation for CABG while\nwaiting for Plavix wash-out. It was noted that he has ~60-69%\nstenosis on left carotid artery based on ultrasound. On [**2110-10-7**],\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent\ncoronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Please see\noperative note for details. In summary he had: Coronary artery\nbypass grafting x2, left internal mammary artery graft to left\nanterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft the marginal\nbranch. His bypass time was 38 minutes with a crossclamp time 29\nminutes. He tolerated the operation well and postoperatively he\nwas taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He woke\nneurologically intact and was extubated on the day of surgery.\nPOD 1 found the patient alert and oriented and breathing\ncomfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and\nhemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.\nBeta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed\ntoward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to\nthe telemetry floor for further recovery on POD2  Chest tubes\nand pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The\npatient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility. On [**10-8**] he had rapid\natrial fibrillation. He was treated with increased beta-blocker\nand Amiodarone, he ultimately converted to nsr. On [**10-11**] he had\natrial flutter and was treated with IV Beta-blocker/Amio bolus\nx2/gtt/IV Diltiazem and once again converted to normal sinus\nrhythm. He continued to require oxygen. CXR revealed a left\npleural effusion. He was transferred back to CVICU for more\nintensive monitoring while a left therapeutic thoracentesis was\nperformed. It drained 450 cc. The oxygen requirement decreased\nand Mr.[**Known lastname **] was transferred back down to the stepdown floor.\nThe remainder of his hospital stay was uneventful.\nBy the time of discharge on POD8 the patient was ambulating\nfreely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral\nanalgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition\nwith visiting nurse services. He is to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]\nin 3 weeks.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- amlodipine 10 mg, once daily\n- aripiprazole 2 mg, once daily\n- fluoxetine 40 mg, once daily\n- omeprazole 20 mg EC, once daily\n- simvastatin 40 mg, once daily\n- trazodone 50 mg, once at bed time (takes regularly)\n- ASA 325 mg, once daily\n- metoprolol ER 25 mg, once at bedtime\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
