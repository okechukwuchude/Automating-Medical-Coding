She was\ndischarged from [**Hospital1 112**] 7 days PTA for COPD and CHF, where she was\ntreated with blood transfusions, steroids and diuresis. Since\ndischarge her dyspnea has progressively worsened.  She states\nthat it is exacerbated by activity and laying flat.  Symptoms\naccompanied by cough with clear sputum for 1 day, palpitations,\nand chest pressure associated with some gas.  No radiation to\nextremities or jaw, diaphoresis.

Diffuse alveolar opacities throughout the lungs,\nright greater than left, which could represent asymmetric edema\nand/or infection. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle\nmay be due to trace pleural effusion. The patient is status post\nmedian sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The\naorta is calcified.\n.\nIMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral, right much greater than left\nalveolar opacities could relate to asymmetric edema and/or\ninfection. Correlate clinically and consider repeat after\ndiuresis. Comparison with prior radiographs would be helpful.\n.\nECHO [**2103-11-26**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial\nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular\nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic\nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal\ndefect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with\nnormal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the\nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe ([**12-21**]+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n80 year old female with COPD, HTN, recurrent anemia, diastolic\nCHF who was admitted for dyspnea and anemia.\n.\n#Dyspnea- The patient was admitted to the MICU with hypoxia to\nthe 70%s on room air.  She briefly required non-invasive\nventilation. She was covered for a possible COPD exacerbation\nwith nebs, prednisone and azithromycin (antibiotic course\ncompleted).  She also was started on a lasix and nitro drip for\nacute on chronic diastolic CHF (EF 60%).  Chest X-ray revealed\nbilateral pulmonary opacities with pulmonary edema.  The patient\ndiuresed well and dyspnea improved, making acute on chronic\ndiastolic CHF the chief diagnosis.  The patient underwent a\ntransthoracic echo that showed moderate to severe MR worsened\nsince [**9-/2103**], which may be contributing to CHF exacerbation.\nCardiac enzymes were negative X3 for ischemic cause of heart\nfailure exacerbation.  Prior to transfer to the floor, lasix and\nnitro drips were discontinued.  The patient was started on\ntorsemide (in place of home lasix) and imdur.  She continued to\ndiurese well.  Her oxygenation improved.  At time of discharge,\nthe patient was saturating well on 3L O2.  She was discharged on\ntorsemide for diuresis and a prednisone taper.\n.\n#Anemia- Patient has a history of significant anemia, with acute\ndecrease in HCT on admission from 30 to 21. Stools guaiac\nnegative.  Patient was transfused 1 unit PRBCs. Hematocrit\nstabilized at 25 for the remainder of admission.  Etiology of\nanemia likely multifactorial, secondary to CKD, repeated\nphlebotomy.  Stools remained guaiac negative throughout\nadmission.\n.\n#Acute on chronic kidney injury - Baseline creatinine is 1.5-2.0\nover the past few months.  With diuresis, creatinine increased\nto 2.4-2.6 daily.  The patient should follow up regarding her\ncreatinine within a week of discharge.\n.\n#Chronic Angina/CAD- Chronic angina has been controlled on\nranolazine and isosorbide mononitrate. Stress test in [**10/2103**]\nrevealed reversible inferior defect on nuclear imaging.  Patient\nremained chest pain free throughout admission.  The patient was\ncontinued on atorvastatin, ASA, hydralazine and imdur.  Ranexa\nwas discontinued due to acute kidney injury.  The patient should\nfollow up with her cardiologist about reinitiation of ranexa\nwith improvement in renal function to baseline.\n.\n# Code:DNR/DNI\n====================================================\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n#The patient should follow up regarding her BUN/creatinine [**12-4**].\n Results to be reported to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n#The patient should follow up with her cardiologist about\nreinitiation of ranexa with improvement in renal function to\nbaseline.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPrednisone 10 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet in morning or as\ndirected\nAtorvastatin 80 mg Oral Tablet Take one-half tablet (40mg) daily\n\nFolic Acid 1 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg Oral Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
