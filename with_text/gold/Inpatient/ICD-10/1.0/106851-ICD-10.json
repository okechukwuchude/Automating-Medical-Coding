He\ninitially presented to the [**Hospital6 **] on [**2163-8-25**]\nfeeling unsafe.  He was able to contract for safety and was\ndischarged with close followup.  He then presented to BU Mental\nHealth feeling unsafe and was section 12 and transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] but he was felt to be safe for discharge and released to\nthe care of his family.  He subsequently ingested unknown\nquantities of ativan, motrin, nyquil, and excedrin pm\napproximately 2 pm on Monday [**9-5**].   He went [**Location (un) 84770**] and wanted to jump in front of a car but couldn't bring\nhimself to do it.  He ultimately sought medical attention about\n7 yours later on Monday evening, after friends found him\nlethargic and vomiting.\n\nIn the ED,vs were: T98.3 P 98 BP 126/76 R16 O2 sat 100% on RA.\nPatient was slightly lethargic appearing but was conversant.

His toxicology screen was otherwise\nnegative. Given that this is within the window for potential\nhepatic toxicity he was started on a n-acetylcysteine drip and\ntransferred to the ICU.\n\nIn the ICU he was monitored on telemetry with no events.  His\ntransaminases were monitored and showed no elevation.  His INR\nrose slightly to 1.5 and then trended down to 1.2.

      "text": "Chief Complaint:  Acetaminophen overdose\n   HPI:\n   This is an 18 year old male with past medical history significant for\n   depression who presents today after an acetaminophen overdose.  The\n   patient has been having problems recently with a break up with his\n   girlfriend and in the context of this relationship ending he has been\n   dealing with worsened depression and suicidal ideation.  Per notes he\n   intially presented to the [**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department on\n   [**2163-8-25**] due to feeling unsafe.  After eventually being able to contract\n   for safety he was discharged with follow up.  In between that emergency\n   department visit and his follow up he once again presented to the BU\n   [**Hospital 9116**] Health Center complaining of feeling unsafe and thoughts of\n   self harm including a plan.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] ED on a\n   section 12 and had been a plan to admit until family showed up and\n   offered to support and observe patient.  Therefore, he was released to\n   their supervision.  In the interim he had been somewhat stable and had\n   been seeing behavioral health at BU.  This afternoon, he spoke to his\n   ex-girlfriend on the phone and became upset with her.  Therefore, he\n   decided he wanted to die and decided the least painful way was with\n   medications.  He took a small amount of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1384**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3268**], 3 mg of\n   lorazepam, 15-20 ibuprofen, excedrin PM, and nyquil.  A friend called\n   911.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is unclear whether he still wants to die.

Therefore, we\n   have initiated NAC protocol.  Currently, INR and LFT's relatively\n   normal\n   -Continue NAC\n   -Recheck labs in AM\n   -F/U tox reccs\n   2) Suicide Attempt/Depression: Patient has flattened affect and serious\n   attempts suggest depression though given clear situational precipitant\n   also possible adjustment disorder.  Very serious attempt after multiple\n   calls for help is concerning.  Likely will need inpatient psych\n   admission after medicine discharge.\n   -1:1 sitter\n   -f/u psych reccs\n   -Social work re: coping\n   3) Other ingestions: Other ingested substances (lorazepam,\n   diphenhydramine, ibuprofen) unlikely to cause end organ damage and\n   would mostly be managed supportively.\n   -Monitory\n   4) PPx: Pneumoboots and ambulate for DVT, will start H2 blocker given\n   large NSAID dose\n   5) FEN: Regular diet, replete lytes PRN\n   6) Code: Full\n   7) Access: PIV's\n   8) Contact: patient doesn't wish for anyone to be called tonight, we\n   will contact family in AM\n   9) Dispo: ICU pending stable LFT's\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2163-9-6**] 01:09 AM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: Boots\n   Stress ulcer: H2 blocker\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: ICU\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   resident for the key portions of the services provided.
