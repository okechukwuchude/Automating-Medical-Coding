The partial focality of her abdominal pain in\n   the RUQ makes a biliary source of her pain concerning.\n   - Appreciate surgery consult.  Will f/u recs.\n   - F/u abdominal US results to look for evidence of cholelithiasis and\n   to assess the patency of the portal vein.\n   # Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleed:  Most likely due to an upper source\n   given that she has had melena.  Unlikely to be secondary to varices as\n   she would have a much brisker bleed and hemeatemesis.  She received 1\n   unit PRBC in the ED.\n   - Will transfuse another two units of PRBC and check a post-transfusion\n   Hct.\n   - Appreciate GI consult, plan for EGD in the am.\n   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV bid.\n   - Active type and screen.\n   - Adequate access - will need a CVL as she has very difficult access.\n   # Abdominal pain:  She has had persistent abdominal pain for multiple\n   weeks and previous hospitalizations and workup has been unrevealing.\n   Differential includes SBP, gastritis, esophagitis, biliary source,\n   diverticulitis (less likely given its characteristics).\n   - Diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP.\n   - Workup of pneumobilia/gallbladder source of pain as above.\n   - EGD in the am.\n   - Prn morphine for pain control.\n   # Hep C Cirrhosis:  Patient is followed at the liver center.  Has known\n   portal gastropathy and grade I esophageal varices.\n   # Alcohol abuse:  Patient continued to drink alcohol and has the smell\n   of alcohol on her currently.\n   - folate, thiamine, MVI\n   - CIWA q4h with ativan prn for CIWA > 10\n   - SW consult\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: NPO, IVF prn\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2186-9-6**] 05:33 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: Boots\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: ICU\n"

Additionally, was called with\nconcern for a small amount of air in her biliary tree.\n\nRUQ US: read was pending when the patient left AMA\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n47 yo female with pmh of Hep C with presumbed cirrhosis and\nhistory of grade I esophageal varices, ETOH abuse, with a recent\nadmissions for C.diff colitis and continued abdominal pain and\nbloody diarrhea admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to concern for a GI\nbleed, also seen to have air in her biliary tree on CT.\n\n# Pneumobilia:  The patient does have a history of ERCP in [**2180**],\nhowever it is unclear that an ERCP 5 years ago could leave\npersistent air in her biliary tree.  The partial focality of her\nabdominal pain in the RUQ makes a biliary source of her pain\nconcerning.  Surgery was consulted and recommended obtaining a\nRUQ US.  This was done and was pending when she left AMA.\n\n# Acute [**Year (4 digits) **] loss anemia/GI bleed:  Most likely due to an upper\nsource given that she has had melena.  Unlikely to be secondary\nto varices as she would have a much brisker bleed and\nhemeatemesis.  She received 1 unit PRBC in the ED.  Plan was to\ntransfuse an additional 2 units and for EGD in the am, however\nshe left AMA before this could be done.\n\nThe patient became very angry when she was told she was NPO.\nShe stated that she was extremely hungry and that she would\nleave our hospital if we didn??????t feed her.  It was explained to\nher that the reason she was NPO was due to concern for an acute,\nserious process in her stomach (due to the air seen in her\nbiliary system on CT).  She stated she understood the risk of\neating while she may be bleeding and may need a procedure to her\nabdomen, but she still wanted to eat.  Upon discussion with our\nteam including our attending, we agreed to let her eat a few\ncrackers if she would stay.  A few minutes later she declared\nshe wanted to leave AMA to go to another hospital.  Per her\nnurse, the nurse had been looking through her purse to identify\nvaluables that could be secured and found klonopin, which would\nhave to be removed from the room; the patient became agitated\nwhen she was informed of this and then decided to leave AMA.  I\ndiscussed with her the risks of leaving when her [**Year (4 digits) **] counts\nwere so low (she had only received 1 unit of PRBC so far) and\nwhen it was unclear if the air in her biliary tree was\nclinically significant.  The risks I discussed included loss of\nconsciousness, further bleeding, worsening clinical status and\ndeath.  She stated she understood the risks and that she planned\nto go to a different hospital to get care.  She signed the AMA\nform and left.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n(per recent discharge summary)\n1. Methadone 40 mg po daily\n2. Senna 8.6 mg 1-2 Tablets PO BID:prn constipation.\n3.
