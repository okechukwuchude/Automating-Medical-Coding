Following\n intravenous administration of Magnevist, sagittal MP-RAGE and axial\n T1-weighted images were obtained.  Axial and coronal reformats were generated\n and reviewed.\n\n FINDINGS:  Again seen are multiple hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding\n edema in the right frontal, left basal ganglia, and left temporal regions.\n Multiple foci of abnormal susceptibility are seen at the [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter\n junction in bilateral frontal lobes which are seen to bloom on the gradient\n echo sequences suggestive of microhemorrhages.  There is no hydrocephalus or\n midline shift.  There is no intraventricular extension of hemorrhage.\n Diffusion-weighted images reveal areas of slow diffusion within the left\n caudate head, distinct from the regions of hemorrhage, representing areas of\n ischemia.  The ischemic changes are likely secondary to injury to the left\n lenticulostriate arteries.  The visualized globes and mastoid air cells are\n unremarkable.  Major intracranial flow voids appear normal.  Abnormal signal\n intensity is seen within the right maxillary sinus, ethmoid and bilateral\n sphenoid sinuses.  Correlating with the CT, multiple facial fractures are\n present with hemosinus.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Multiple hemorrhagic contusions in bilateral cerebral hemispheres as\n demonstrated on the previous CT.  In addition, there are multiple tiny foci of\n microhemorrhages, predominantly at the [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter junction in the\n frontal lobes consistent with diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury.\n 2.  Areas of ischemia in the left caudate head likely from injury to the\n lenticulostriate branches.  The A1 and M1 segments of the anterior and middle\n cerebral arteries respectively appear grossly normal.  Please note that\n lenticulostriate arteries are much below the resolution of noninvasive imaging\n and cannot be reliably evaluated on CTA/MRA.\n\n Findings discussed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 685**] [**Name (STitle) 686**] with [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33402**] on [**2142-10-9**]\n at 1:00 p.m.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2142-10-8**] 7:58 PM\n MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST                                        Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 43163**]\n Reason: please evaluate for intracranial process, diffuse axonal inj\n Admitting Diagnosis: BLUNT TRAUMA\n  Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 17\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n"

There are multiple foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage\nseen within the grey-white matter junction of the left frontal\nlobe and right frontal lobe towards the vertex, as well as the\nleft basal ganglia and left internal capsule. A tiny focus of\nextra-axial hemorrhage adjacent to the right frontal\nintraparenchymal\nhemorrhage also is likely present suggestive of subarachnoid\nblood. Thin hyperdensity layering along the left tentorium may\nrepresent a tiny subdural hemorrhage. There is no evidence of\nedema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface is well preserved with no evidence\nof acute major vascular territorial infarct. The ventricles and\nsulci are normal in size and configuration.\n\nThe extracalvarial soft tissues show right frontal scalp and\nperiorbital hematoma. Multiple facial fractures are identified\nof the right superior lateral orbital wall and inferolateral\norbital wall. There is a fracture of the floor of the right\norbit with a displaced fragment displaced in the right maxillary\nsinus without herniation of extraocular musculature.\nOpacification in the right maxillary sinus and right ethmoid air\ncells suggests hemorrhage from the multiple facial fractures.\nThe skull base is intact without fracture. The bilateral globes\nare intact with lenses in place bilaterally.\nNo retrobulbar hematoma present.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages compatible with diffuse\naxonal injury.\n2. Tiny extra-axial hemorrhage noted adjacent to the right\nfrontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely subarachnoid blood.\nSmall subdural hemorrhage layering over the left tentorium.\n3. Facial fractures as described above. A dedicated\nmaxillofacial CT would be recommended when possible for further\nevaluation.\n\nCThead [**10-5**]:\nFINDINGS: Right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with a\nfluid-fluid level seen dependently is redemonstrated, unchanged\nin size. Foci of left frontal and temporal parenchymal\nhemorrhage are also redemonstrated, also appearing unchanged.\nThere is no new intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or\nvascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are\nunchanged in size\nand in configuration. An intracranial bolt is visualized, placed\nvia a right frontal approach.\n\nOsseous structures are notable for a comminuted fracture\ninvolving the superolateral corner of the right orbit anteriorly\nwith adjacent extraconal hematoma slightly impinging on the\nglobe. Additionally, there is a comminuted right orbital floor\nfracture with a fallen osseous fragment, though no evidence of\nentrapment of the inferior rectus extraocular muscle. A\nminimally displaced fracture is also visualized in the right\nanterior maxillary sinus wall. There is expected near total\nopacification of the right maxillary sinus. The pterygoid\nplates, and zygomatic arches are intact. The lamina papyracea\nare intact. The nasal septum is intact, and notable for a\nmoderate-sized rightward nasal septal spur. There is a minimally\ndisplaced right nasal bone fracture. Note is made of partial\nopacification of ethmoidal air cells bilaterally, greater on the\nright than left as well as moderate mucosal thickening in the\nleft maxillary sinus, sphenoid sinus and frontal sinuses. The\nsphenoid sinus contains a single dominant septum which\nterminates near the midline.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral parenchymal hemorrhage as described above, similar\nto the most recent comparison study.\n2. Right facial fractures as characterized above.\n\nCThead [**10-8**]\nFINDINGS: Again seen are multiple evolving intraparenchymal\nhematomas, without significant interval change in size since the\nprior study of [**2139-10-6**]. There is mild interval increase in the\nedema surrounding these hemorrhagic contusions, especially\nsurrounding the large hematoma in the right frontal vertex. The\nlarge right frontal vertex hematoma now measures 2.8 x 2.3 cm,\nwhich allowing for differences in technique is unchanged since\nthe prior study 3.0 x 2.2 cm. Mild effacement of the right\nfrontal hemispheric sulci, is more prominent since the prior\nstudy. No significant shift of midline structures is seen.\nMultiple parenchymal hematomas in the left frontal lobe, left\ncaudate nucleus, basal ganglia, temporal lobe, are again\nredemonstrated. No new intracranial hematoma is seen. The\nventricles and sulci are unchanged in appearance. There is no\nintraventricular extension of hemorrhage. The basal cisterns are\nnormal. Multiple facial fractures including right superolateral\norbital fracture, right orbital floor fracture are again\nredemonstrated. There is diffuse opacification of the right\nmaxillary, right ethmoid sinuses, with air-fluid levels in both\nsphenoid sinuses.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Evolving intraparenchymal hematomas, without significant\ninterval change in size. Mildly increased surrounding edema and\nmass effect.\n2. No evidence of transtentorial herniation. No new parenchymal\nhematomas.\n\nLUE duplex [**10-7**]\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of left internal\njugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial veins were performed.\nThere is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation\nthroughout. The left cephalic and basilic veins are normal.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.\n\nMR [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**10-8**]:\nFINDINGS: Cervical vertebrae reveal normal height, signal\nintensity and alignment. Craniocervical junction appears normal.\nCervical spinal cord reveals normal morphology and signal\nintensity. Pre- and paravertebral and posterior paraspinal soft\ntissues appear unremarkable. Fluid signal is seen within the\noropharynx and around the endotracheal tube, likely secondary to\nintubation.\n\nThere is no spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing seen.\nIntervertebral discs are normal in height and signal\nintensities. There is no evidence of ligamentous injuries.\n\nIMPRESSION: Unremarkable MRI of the cervical spine.\n\nLENI [**10-12**]\nFINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common\nfemoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and\nperoneal veins were performed. There is normal compressibility,\nflow and augmentation.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.\n\nCT torso [**10-14**]\nFINDINGS:\n\nCHEST: The visualized portion of the thyroid is unremarkable.\nThere is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A\ntracheostomy tube is in place. The aorta is of a normal caliber\nalong its course without evidence of injury. The pulmonary\nartery shows no large central filling defect. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nAssessment of fine detail of the lungs is slightly limited by\nmild motion artifact. Bibasilar consolidations have worsened\ncompared to prior study. Additionally, the previously described\nright lower lobe anterior basal segment contusion demonstrates a\nmore confluent well-rounded appearance, possibly representing\nrounded atelectasis or a focal area of diaphragmatic eventration\n(2:45), measuring 26 x 17 mm. There is no large pleural effusion\nor pneumothorax.\n\nABDOMEN: A gastrostomy tube is in place. Extensive streak\nartifact is seen from the oral contrast administered as well as\nfrom excreted IV contrast in the renal collecting systems. There\nis no evidence of extraluminal contrast or free air. There is no\nperihepatic or perisplenic fluid. The kidneys enhance with and\nexcrete contrast symmetrically. The visualized portion of large\nand small bowel show significant colonic fecal load. The aorta\nshows no evidence of injury.\n\nBONES: Again are seen fractures of the anterior portions of the\nleft second and third ribs as well as the anterior portions of\nthe right second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Worsening bibasilar consolidations as described above.\n2. Status post PEG tube placement without evidence of free air\nor extraluminal contrast.\n3. Multiple rib fractures as described above.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care\nUnit for evaluation and treatment of polytrauma following MCC.\nAttending of record was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Acute Care Surgical\nService.\n\nInjuries at time of admission:\n- RUL pulm contusion\n- multifocal areas of probable aspiration\n- b/l rib fxs(2nd, 3rd L, 5th on R)\n- intraparenchymal hem L frontal lobe\n- focus of SAH at R frontovertex\n- R inf+sup orbit floor [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] sinus fx\n- R non-displaced rad/uln fx\n\nOn [**10-4**] the patient underwent placement of R bolt for ICP\nmonitoring which went well without complication (reader referred\nto the Operative Notes for details).
