In the ambulance she was\nnoted to be diaphoretic, pale, nausea with vomiting and\ndizzzines.  The initial EKG showed junctional bradycardia in\n40s.  A subsequent 12 lead EKG demonstrated aflutter with 5:1\nconduction with rates between 49 and 52.  In the ED Code STEMI\nwas activated given STE in I and aVL and patient determined to\nbe medically managed and NOT taken to cath lab.  She was sent\nfor CT chest to r/o aortic dissection and after put on heparin\ndrip, asa, nitro drip, morphine, and continued on her home dose\nof lasix, hydrochlorothiazide, and home benazepril was changed\nto lisinopril (unknown dose).\n\nHer exam at OSH was notable for BP systolic 160s both upper\nextremities, bradycardia, crackles in left base, 2+ pitting\nedema in LE bilaterally, and skin tear on left elbow with\nbrusing and echhymoses.

ECG changes indicated likely completed STEMI that\ncould be contributing to bradycardia vs acute on chronic\nprocess. Patient felt dizzy when walking with physical therapy.\nAt this point in time it was decided to not place a pacemaker.\n\n# Completed STEMI: Trop peak was 1.5 at the outside hospital.\nShe was treated with heparin for 2 days as ACS treatment. She\nwas also given aspirin and plavix. Her beta blocker wa held\nbecause of slow heart rate. She was not brought to cath lab\nbecause it was believed this was a completed MI. On [**8-18**] her\nCKMB was down to 4  and trop down to .32.\n\n# Right arm hematoma: Patientn came home with a right arm\nhematoma. She did not recall how she got this though it is\npossible it was related to when she fell before coming in.\nDuring hospital stay the hematoma got larger and we consulted\nvascular and hand surgery for their input. They could obtain an\nulnar pulse on doppler and recommended the patient be monitored\nand there was no need to do any surgery at this time. We did\nfurther imaging which showed a brachial artery dissection with\nno fractures in any of the bones in her arm. We gave her\ntramadol and tylenol for pain while she was uncomfortable.\n\n#Vertigo: On [**8-20**] patient started feeling vertigo. She described\na dizziness like the room is spinning sensation. She said it was\nworse when turning her head. We felt this was either Meuniere's\nvs benign position veritgo vs a small stroke involving the\nbrainstem. We started her on meclizine on day of discharge and\nordered a soft collar to prevent neck movements.\n\n# HTN: Her SBPs were in the 160s-170s. We stopped her home hctz\nand started amlodipine. She was also on captopril which was\nchanged to her home benazepril at discharge. Her goal SBP Is\n140.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES.\n# Hypothryoidism: TSH nl. We continued home levothyroxine\n\n# HLD: stable We continued home simvastatin\n\n# GERD/Hiatal hernia\n-Pantoprazole 40 mg daily\n\n#HL\n-Simvastatin 20 mg daily\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n#veritgo: patietn should follow up with PCP\n#[**Name10 (NameIs) **] hematoma showed be followed up with vascular surgery if\ndoes not resolve.\n#hypertension: we started amlodipine during hosptial stay and\ndiscontinued her home thiazide. Her SBPs were in the 140's.\n#Bradycardia with heart block: should be followed up with\noutpatient cardiologist in terms of if patient will need a\npacemaker in the future.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1.

You had a heart attack before you came\nand you have been started on medicines to help your heart\nrecover. Your heart rate has been slow for a long time so a\npacemaker was not placed. You had some fluid overload and was\ngiven diuretics to remove the fluid. A large bruise developed\nover your upper and lower right arm and you were seen by a\nvascular surgeon, a rheumatologist and a plastic surgeon. They\nhave all agreed that it is resolving on it's own. Please be sure\nto keep it elevated. You have new dizziness that may have been\ncaused by a very small stroke. You are now on aspirin and plavix\nfor your heart that may also help to prevent further strokes.\nYour vertigo should go away as you recover.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: BIDHC [**Location (un) **]\nWhen: FRIDAY [**2179-9-24**] at 11:00 AM\nWith: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**0-0-**]\nBuilding: [**Street Address(2) 1126**] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) 861**]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: On Street Parking\n\n\n                             [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 2362**]\n\n"
