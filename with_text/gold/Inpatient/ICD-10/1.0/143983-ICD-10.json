His RR was elevated to the 40s-60s. He was given an\nalbuterol neb without improvement. Patient is non-verbal at\nbaseline, but per facility report he has been less responsive\nthan usual. A blood gas done at rehab showed pH 7.52, CO2, 30,\nO2 76. INR was 3.8 on coumadin which was held today.\n\nIn the ED, initial VS were: 98.8 94 116/78 20 96%, RR ranging\nfrom 30s to 50s. Physical exam was notable for mental status\nthat was not responsive to voice but withdrawing to pain, 2+\nreflexes, EOMI, PERRL. Lungs were distant but diffuslely CTAB in\nsetting of tachypnea. Labs were signifcant for leukocytosis to\n14, lactate 2.2, INR 5.5. CT head showed no new ICH. CTA chest\nshowed decreased clot burden, new patchy infiltrates on left,\nstable opacities on the right. He was given on ceftriaxone, levo\n(vanco ordered but not received in ED). He was given tylenol for\nfever. VS prior to transfer were T: 101.4, 91, RR 50, BP:\n114/60, 98% on trach mask.\n.\nOn arrival to the MICU, patient was tachypneic.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Bilateral PEs on coumadin (diagnosed [**2176-11-25**])\n-Subarchnoid hemorrhage [**1-17**] aneurysm and s/p VP shunt placement,\n\ntracheostomy and PEG placement\n-Hyptertension\n-Hyperlipidemia\n-TIA\n-?

A\nright frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter terminates\nwithin the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle,\nunchanged in position in comparison to [**2176-11-27**]\nexamination. The ventricles are enlarged though stable in size.\n\n\nThere has been interval decrease in blood products seen layering\nposteriorly within the occipital horns of lateral ventricles\n(2:16). Previously seen subarachnoid hemorhage no longer\nvisualized. No acute hemorrhage or large vascular territorial\ninfarction is seen.\n\nFocal hypodensities along the periventricular white matter\n(2:20, 21) and\nwithin a large area along the ACA territory bilaterally (2:10)\nare unchanged, compatible with encephalomalacia and chronic\nmicrovascular\nischemic disease.\n\nThere is no acute fracture. A large scalp lipoma overlying the\nleft calvarium (2:19) is again seen. There is mild mucosal\nthickening within the right ethmoid air cells.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Decreased intraventricular hemorrhage.\n2. Resolved subarachnoid hemorrhage. No new hemorrhage.\n3. Unchanged ventriculomegaly with a right frontal approach\nventriculostomy\ncatheter.\n4. Bifrontal ACA distribution infarcts superimposed on chronic\nmicrovascular\nischemic changes within the periventricular white matter.\n\nCT Chest [**2176-12-8**]\nTECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the chest were\nobtained prior to and following the uneventful administration of\n100 cc of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal\nreformations were performed at 2-mm slice thickness. Additional\nright and left oblique reconstructions were performed for\nfurther evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature.\n\nFINDINGS: The thyroid is normal. The patient is status post\ntracheostomy\n(2:28). A ventriculoperitoneal shunt transverses along the right\nchest wall (2:31).\n\nThe heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion.\nModerate\natherosclerotic calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic\naorta which is normal in caliber. No intramural or intramural\nhematoma is detected. There is no dissection.\n\nPreviously seen bilateral pulmonary emboli are no longer\nvisualized to the\nsubsegmental levels, although evaluation of the lower segmental\nand\nsubsegmental branches is limited due to patient motion.\n\nThere is persistent moderate right basilar atelectasis with air\nbronchograms (3:56, 58); an early consolidation in this region\ncannot be excluded. A trace right pleural effusion is decreased\nin size.\n\nScattered opacity is new in the left lower lobe\nposteriorly(3:52), concerning for aspiration and/or early\npneumonia. The left upper lobe remains clear. There is no\npneumothorax.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture. No concerning\nblastic or\nlytic lesions are identified.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Interval resolutino of pulmonary emboli.\n2. New left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia or\naspiration.\n3. Interval decrease in trace right pleural effusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPrimary Reason for Hospitalization:\n84M with recent admission for SAH secondary to aneursym s/p\ncoiling, intraventricular shunt, trach and PEG ([**Date range (1) 91301**]),\nand bilateral PEs (12/12-15/11) presenting from rehab with\ntachypnea and found to have pneumonia, likely secondary to\naspiration.\n\nActive Issues:\n# Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:\nLikely secondary to aspiration event from tube feeds. He was\ninitially started on vanco, cefepime and levofloxacin (day\n1=[**12-9**]). Levofloxacin was stopped [**12-10**], and he will be\ncontinued on vancomycin and cefepime through PICC line for total\n8 day course, through [**2176-12-17**].  Vanc trough on [**12-11**] was 16.\nPICC line can be d/c'd once IV antibiotics are completed.  (Of\nnote, only received 1 dose of levofloxacin due to low suspicion\nfor resistant GNR infection.  If pt worsens after discharge\nwould recommend restarting levofloxacin for double coverage.)\nHe was evaluated by speech & [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] family request, who\nconfirms that patient should remain NPO, everything per G-tube.\n\n# Multiple Pulmonary Emboli:\nPatient had RUL,RLL, LUL and left lingula lobar and segmental\npulmonary emboli at last hospitalization 12/12-19/11 and was\nstarted on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR supratherapeutic on\nadmission. He was given 5 mg vitamin K to lower INR when it\npeaked at 7. Elevated INR likely related to metronidazole and\nlevofloxacin use.  He was restarted on warfarin dose 2.5mg on\n[**2176-12-11**], and his INR on discharge was 2.3.  His INR should be\nmonitored frequently while on metronidazole (see attached\nsheet).\n\n# C. diff:\nDiagnosed [**12-2**] at rehab and started on oral metronidazole which\nwas continued during this admission.  No further diarrhea by\ntime of admission here on [**12-8**].  He should continue\nmetronidazole 500mg Q8 hours until 2 weeks after completion of\nIV antibiotics for HCAP (until [**1-1**]).\n\n# ARF:\nPresented with acute renal failure (creatinine elevated to 1.1\nfrom baseline 0.5), likely prerenal [**1-17**] infection, which\nresolved with hydration.  On discharge his creatinine was 0.4.\nHis losartan was held during hospitalization and should be\nrestarted on discharge.\n\n# UTI: UA consistent with UTI. Foley was placed during admission\n[**10/2176**], and family understands the benefit in setting of sacral\nulcers. He was treated with vancomycin and cefepime as above for\npneumonia.\n\nChronic Issues:\n# Hx SAH: Patient was admitted on [**10-28**] w SAH and IVH now s/p\nACOM coiling, VP shunt placement, tracheostomy and PEG\nplacement. Had repeat MRI/MRA per neurosurg recs, will be\ncontact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurg) as outpatient regarding\nthese results.\n\n# Hypertension: Pt's home losartan held during hospitalization\nfor ARF, should be restarted on discharge.\n\nTransitional issues:\n- INR should be monitored closely while on metronidazole (was\nsupratherapeutic on admission and warfarin held, restarted\n[**12-11**])\n- Would recheck WBC if respiratory status worsens, if increasing\nconsider restarting levofloxacin\n- Should continue IV vanc/cefepime until [**12-18**], can d/c PICC once\nantibiotic course complete\n- Should continue PO metronidazole until 2 weeks after\ncompleting IV antibiotics for c diff infection\n- Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) will contact patient as outpatient\nwith results of MRI.
