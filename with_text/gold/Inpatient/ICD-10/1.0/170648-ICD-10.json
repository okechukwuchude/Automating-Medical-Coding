Pt was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care\nUnit, placed on a PPI drip, Foley for hemodynamic monitoring and\nserial Hematocrits.  Angio was performed [**4-15**], and his GDA was\nembolized. He was transfered to the floor [**4-16**] with stable HCT.\nOn the morning of [**4-17**] he was noted to have a lower HCT and\ntachycardia with BRBPR and he was again transferred to the ICU\nfor management of an acute GI bleed. He underwent repeat EGD,\nwhich showed extensive clot in the stomach. Unable to ID source\nof bleeding, though felt to be from duodenum. He then had\nmassive UGI bleed, receiving 12u PRBC and becoming unstable. He\nthen was taken to the operating [****], where a gastrotomy\nwas created, the stents were taken out through his pylorus, and\nthe duodenum was packed with surgicel. The abdomen was left\nopen. He received 34 units perioperatively, as well as profuse\namounts of FFP and cryo. he was taken back to OR for abdominal\nclosure [**4-20**] and then was transferred back to the floor. He\nremained there with a hct in the low 30s with no transfusions x\n2 days. Of note, he was found to have enterococcus in his blood,\nand so he stayed in house on the floor to receive antibiotics.\nOn [**4-27**] there was bilious staining noted on the vac. However, a\ncholangiogram was not concerning for leak. [**4-27**] Hct was 32.8 and\nthe pt was asymptomatic all day. However, later in the evening\nhe vomited blood. At that time, his SBP was 100, HR 120 and the\nVac output became bloody from bilious. [**4-28**] he was transfered\nagain to the  SICU for hematemesis--mixed dark and bright red\nblood per mouth and rectum. An NGT was placed but unable to\nlavage due to thick stomach contents. He was monitored on Q2h\nhcts and coags and transfused 3uPRBC overnight. HDS. On [**4-29**] he\nhad 900cc of emesis (dark red blood, most likely old blood) and\nremained tachycardic, however his HCT initially remained stable\nat 28.0. Later that day he had 600cc dark bloody emesis, RBCs &\nFFP were given, trauma line was placed, and emergent endoscopy\nwas performed. This revealed grade II/III esophageal and gastric\nvarices. 10 RBC's & 8 FFP were given, as was Activated Factor\nVII was administered and he required pressors for SBP support.\nOn [**4-30**] he came off pressors, and his HCT was stable. He was\nstarted on TPN, however he required massive transfusion that\nafternoon after copious hematemesis and melena with a HCT of 15.\nHe was transfued 22U PRBC, 2FFP, 2plts, 3000mcg factor 7\n(40mcg/kg). He was scoped by GI, who placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] - noting\npossible bleed from both GE junction and duodenum/stomach. Given\nhis worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing lactate bicarb gtt\n& phenylephrine gtt were restarted overnight. He was also\nmaintained on ARDS protocol on the vent. On [**5-1**] a family\nmeeting was held and, given the lack of surgical option and the\nintractable bleeding, the decision was made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].\nOn [**5-2**] he expired with family at the bedside and time of death\nwas called at 20:34.\n[**5-2**]: [**Month/Day (4) 3225**]\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. amlodipine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. ursodiol 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times\na day).\n3. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
