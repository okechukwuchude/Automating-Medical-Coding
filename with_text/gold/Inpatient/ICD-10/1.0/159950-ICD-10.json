Given her recent influenza, she was was covered for\nMRSA with vancomycin. Pt also with history of ESBL and was\nstarted on meropenem (Day 1=[**4-19**]). Pt was initialy closely\nmonitored in the MICU where she was intubated. Her pulmonary\nstatus improved and she was extubated on [**4-20**]. Pt's fevers\nimproved and her leukocytosis resolved (WBC 22->6). For possible\nCOPD exacerbation, she was continued on prednisone 20mg daily.\nShe will taper down to 10mg daily in 3 days. CXR showed some\nsigns of pulmonary edema, esp in the setting of getting IVF\nwhile in the MICU, and she was diursed with IV lasix (10-20mg\ndaily for 2 days). Sputum culture notable for rare growth of\ncoag positive aureus, MSSA plus some rare GNR.  She had a PICC\nplaced for antibiotic course of treatment for presumed HCAP.\nVancomycin was stopped on [**2195-4-23**] (completed 5 day course) and\nshe will continue meropenem for total 7 day course (through\n[**2195-4-26**]).\n\nAspiration Concern: Pt had speech and swallow video study and\npassed. She was restarted on dysphagia diet of pureed solids and\nnectar think liquids. Explained to pt's family that she is at\nrisk for aspiration.\n\n[**Year (4 digits) **]: Patient with [**Year (4 digits) **] in dependent areas on back (flank\nregions bilaterally) and part of stomach. Crosses midline so\nunlikely Zoster. Likely to be contact dermatitis as [**Year (4 digits) **] existed\nprior to antibiotic administration.\n\nDementia: Patient non-verbal at baseline.  Passed swallow\nevaluation and was restarted on dysphagia diet.\n\nAnemia: Patient??????s recent HCT baseline around 28-31. During this\nhospitalization, her HCT stable around 23-25 and was 26 at time\nof discharge. Likely hemodilutional component in setting of IVF\nin addition to likely marrow suppresion in setting of acute\nillness.\n\nPending Labs:\n-Blood cultures from [**4-19**]\n\nTransition of care:\n-FULL code, verified by family\n-Pneumonia: will need to complete course of meropenem\n-Aspiration: family aware of pt's aspiration risk.\n-Anemia: would trend HCT while outpatient. HCT stable and\ntrending up while inpatient. Reccoment CBC check on [**2195-3-29**].\nIf HCT continues to decrease, would reccomend anemia workup.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n# prednisone 20 mg daily\n# morphine 4 mg Q2 H prn\n# Albuterol prn\n# vitamin d 1000 U\n# Ipratropium neb Q4H\n# Dulcolax suppository\n# Miralax 17 g daily\n# Ativan 0.25 mg Q4H prn\n# Aspirin 81 mg daily\n# Tylenol 650 mg suppository\n# albuterol neb q6H\n# ipratropium neb Q6H\n# senna 17.2 mg daily\n# zinc oxide topical\n.\nper last d/c summary\n# albuterol sulfate prn\n# aspirin 81 mg daily\n# bisacodyl 10 mg pr\n# Vitamin D 1,000 unit daily\n# ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Q4H\n# polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram daily\n# prednisone 40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10\nmg ongoing\n# acetaminophen 650 mg prn\n# docusate sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily):\nIn the next 3 days, can taper to 10mg daily and continue 10mg.\n2. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n3. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal\nat bedtime as needed for constipation.\n4.
