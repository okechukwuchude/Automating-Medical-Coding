The patient\nremained neurologically intact and without change from baseline\nduring their stay. The patient remained alert and oriented to\nperson, location and place. Sequential neurologic exams were\nrepeated Q4 hours and were stable post-op.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable\nintra-op and in the immediate post-operative period. He\nextubated and was weaned from pressors.  He was transferred to\nthe surgical step down floor by the following day.  Chest tubes\nand epicardial wires were removed.  The patient's\ncardioprotective dose of Aspirin was continued post-op.\nCoumadin was started for his history of strial fibrillation.\n\nRESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op\nperiod successfully. The patient had no episodes of desaturation\nor pulmonary concerns. The patient denied cough or respiratory\nsymptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient\nmaintained adequate oxygenation.\n\nGASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure\nand transitioned to sips and a clear liquid diet on POD#0. The\npatient experienced no nausea or vomiting. The patient was\ntransitioned to a regular/cardiac healthy diet on POD#1 and IV\nfluids were discontinued once adequate PO intake was\nestablished.\n\nGENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored\nin the immediate post-operative period. A Foley catheter was\nplaced intra-operatively and removed on POD#1, at which time the\npatient was able to successfully void without issue. The\npatient's intake and output was closely monitored for > 30 mL\nper hour output. The patient's creatinine was stable.\n\nHEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was stable and trended\nclosely. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not\nrequire transfusion. The patient's coagulation profile remained\nnormal. The patient had no evidence of bleeding from his\nincision.  After his bypass coumadin for atrial fibrillation was\nrestarted.\n\nID: The patient showed no signs of infection and remained\nafebrile in the post-op period. Their white count was stable\npost-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for\nany evidence of infection or erythema. The patient received only\nstandard peri-operative antibiotics, and did not require further\nantibiotics post-op.\n\nENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was closely monitored in\nthe post-op period with Q6 hour glucose checks. Blood glucose\nlevels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin\nsliding scale.\n\nPROPHYLAXIS:  The patient also had sequential compression boot\ndevices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.\nGI prophylaxis was sustained with Protonix/Famotidine when\nnecessary. The patient was encouraged to utilize incentive\nspirometry, ambulate early and was discharged in stable\ncondition to [**Hospital 1886**] rehab in [**Last Name (un) **] on post-operative day five\nfrom his bypass.  All follow-up appointments were advised.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAllopurinol 300 mg', Fluocinonide 0.05% cream, Ketoconazole 2%\ncream PRN, Metoprolol 100 mg'', Nifedipine 30 mg ER',\nNitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL PRN, Simvastatin 80 mg', Warfarin 5 mg',\nAspirin 81 mg', MVI, Naproxen 220 mg' PRN\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. allopurinol 300 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n3. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every\n6 hours) as needed for Pain.\n5.
