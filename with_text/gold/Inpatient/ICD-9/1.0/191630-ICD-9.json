There, EKG showed with AV pacing\nand trop found to be elevated to 0.4 (baseline per ED there is\n0.3). Got PR ASA and was sent here for ROMI/NSTEMI.\n\nOn arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED last night, pressures remained low,\nhypoxic on 3L (unclear baseline O2 requirement).  BP's were\n90/palp and pt was bradycardic to 38 (though unclear how it's\npossible given that pt is paced).  Given slightly higher trop,\nthere was initial concern for NSTEMI.  He receive 2L IVF for his\nhypotension and cardiology was consulted.  They were not\nconcerned given trop around baseline.  Unclear if EKG's were\nfaxed for them to look at.  Overnight, pressures improved with\nIVF, no antibiotics or blood cultures were drawn.  Fingersticks\ncontinued to be low 40-80 and he was started on D5 gtt at 100\ncc/hr.  BP's overnight continued to be low and this morning D5\nincreased to 150cc/hr.\n\nCT torsos (one without contrast and one with contrast) were\nobtained to look for source of hypoglycemia and found a\nlarge-moderate intussception and L3/L4 discitis.  Surgery was\nconsulted for intussception and felt comfortable with medical\nadmission, no emergent surgery given lactate 0.6 this morning at\n3am.  Radiology read partial obstruction with small amount of\ncontrast passing through but very edematous bowel and\nrecommended that surgery address. Additionally, renal masses\nconcerning for RCC were noted which are old.

No evidence of\nproximal\ndilation of bowel to suggest obstruction at the time of the\nexamination but correlation with physical examination is\nrecommended.\n2. Destructive change of L3-4 endplates with appearance of\nwidening of\nintervertebral space, unchanged from CT of lumbar spine of\n[**2167-6-29**], may\nagain represent noninfective spondyloarthropathy although\nsuperimposed\ninfection (discitis/osteomyelitis) cannot be entirely excluded\nand clinical correlation is necessary.\n3. Cholelithiasis in a moderately distended gallbladder. Cannot\nassess\ngallbladder wall without IV contrast. If concern for acute\ncholecystitis,\nrecommend ultrasound or HIDA. Unchanged probable stone or sludge\nin the CBD.\n4. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the left\nand small on\nthe right. Ascites and anasarca.\n5. Marked coronary artery calcifications. Marked vascular\ncalcifications\nthroughout the abdomen.\n\nCT A/P ([**2167-7-7**]) - IMPRESSION:\n1. Persistent jejunojejunal intussusception at the distal\nanastomosis with\nmarked bowel wall edema in the intussuscepted bowel and partial\nsmall bowel obstruction.\n2. Oral contrast in the excluded stomach and afferent limb,\nconsistent with either represent reflux secondary to obstruction\nfrom the intussusception or a fistula between the gastric\nremnant and the excluded stomach or components of both\nprocesses.\n3. Bilateral enhancing renal masses. The largest one in the left\nupper pole demonstrates interval increase in size. Findings are\nagain concerning for renal cell carcinoma.\n4. Unchanged cystic pancreatic lesions. Could be further\nassessed by MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 40806**]y indicated.\n5. Similar destructive appearance of L3-L4 compared to the prior\nL-spine CT study eight days ago. Findings again may represent\nrenal spondyloarthropathy but clinical correlation is necessary\nto exclude osteomyelitis/discitis.\n6. Similar cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, without\nevidence of acute cholecystitis.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD\nM/W/F, diabetes, sCHF EF 40%, HTN, HLP, borderline PD who was\nfound to be unresponsive at HD with BP 70/40 and fingerstick to\nfs 41 thought to be secondary to UTI.\n\n# Hypoglycemia: Etiology unclear. In the MICU, patient initially\nrequired D10 gtt which was then weaned off. However, several\nhours after the D10 gtt was stopped, the patient's blood sugars\ndropped back down to the 60's, ultimately requiring the D10 gtt\nto be restarted. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was unrevealing and TSH was WNL.\nPatient transferred to the floor. There remained off D10gtt\nhowever blood sugars remained labile with pre-prandial fs\nrunnning in the 70s during which patient asymptomatic. [**Last Name (un) **]\nfollowing the patient and also unclear on etiology of persistent\nhypoglycemia. Per their rec's sent C-peptide and insulin level\nwhich is still pending. He will follow up with [**Hospital 387**] clinic for\nfurther workup of this. He has had stable blood sugars for\nseveral days on the general medical floor on no anti-glycemic\nmedications.\n.\n# UTI: UA on admission grossly positive. As had history of\npseudomonal urosepsis, decision was made initially to treat with\ncefepime. However, urine cultures ultimately grew Klebsiella\nresistant to cefepime, so the patient was switched to meropenem,\nto complete a 7 day course (end date [**7-18**]). Midline placed to\nfacilitate antibiotic administration as outpatient. PICC line\nunable to be placed as subclavian thrombosed per IR. Etiology of\nrecurrent UTIs felt secondary to stasis therefore foley was\nd/c'ed with decision for QD/[**Hospital1 **] bladder scans and straight cath.\nPatient will continue to need QD/[**Hospital1 **] straight caths in future -\nand education will be needed for both patient and wife in order\nto be able to do this at home. There are also plans for him to\nfollow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] (urology) for evaluation and possible\nnephrectomy as he has a renal mass seen on multiple CT scans\n(this admission and prior) and this may keep him from making\nurine which he retains causing the frequent UTIs. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**]\nwill set him up with an appointment in the next few weeks.\n .\n#History of C.diff. In house C.diff negx2. However, given\npatient's history of severe c.diff infection and current use of\nmeropenem, ID consult service recommended treating empirically\nfor c.diff with flagyl for 14day (end date [**7-25**]).\n.\n# Hypoxia: Occurred in MICU in setting of IVF for hypotension\nand known sCHF 40% EF.  CXR with mild volume o/l. Resolved with\nHD and fluid removal. On the floor patient saturated well on RA.\n\n# Hypotension: Occurred at HD and in ED on presentation.\nPersisted in the MICU and gradually resolved with IVF and\nantibiotics likely in setting of infection. Patient\nasymptomatically hypotensive on floor with SBP ranging between\n80s-110s. Difficult to obtain accurate [**Location (un) 1131**] in HD patient.\nAnti-hypetensives were held. Occasional 250mL Boluses were given\nif SBP<80.\n\n# Intussception:  See on CT, moderate-to-large.  Surgery\nrecommended admission to medicine service for initial\nmanagement. However, surgicaly repair remained an option.\nUltimately, the decision was made to monitor patient with serial\nabdominal exam and lactate levels. Surgery was reassured with\nlactate level of 0.6. On the floor patient without pain and\ntolerating a regular diet without nausea, vomiting or pain. Plan\nto follow-up with GI as outpatient as there is concern regarding\nthe nidus for intussception ?cancer ?polyp.\n\n# Discitis:  Appears old - seen on prior imaging.

PICC placement too difficult at\n  bedside.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n INDICATION:  70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,\n diabetes, CHF, hypertension and discitis, admitted for complication of\n urosepsis.  Pre-existing hemodialysis line on the right and central IJ on\n left.  For PICC placement, too difficult at bedside.\n\n RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 596**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], the\n attending radiologist, was present and supervised throughout.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the\n left brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a\n micropuncture set.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and\n immediately after establishing intravenous access.  A 0.018 guidewire was\n advanced into the left subclavian vein, but stopped more proximally.  A 0.018\n nitinol and angled Glidewire were used in an attempt to pass this obstructed\n area into the SVC.  These attempts failed.  Next, a 5 French 40-cm Kumpe\n catheter was advanced and a 0.016 Headliner used attempt to pass this\n apparently occluded area.  This was unsuccessful.  Injection of contrast\n indicated occlusion of the more proximal SVC with contrast seen in the azygos\n system.  The fluoro team was consulted and representative for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2622**]\n indicated that a midline would be sufficient for the medical needs of the\n patient.  Therefore, a peel-away sheath was placed over a guidewire and a PICC\n line measuring 26 cm in length placed through the peel-away sheath with its\n tip positioned in the mid subclavian vein under fluoroscopic guidance.\n Position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.\n The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was\n secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient\n tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Complicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically left double-lumen\n PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach.  There is apparent\n occlusion of the proximal subclavian vein at its confluence with the SVC.\n Final internal PICC length is 26 cm with the tip positioned in the subclavian\n vein.  The line is ready to use.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2167-7-14**] 2:32 PM\n PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH                                          Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 50278**]\n Reason: Has HD line on right and Central IJ on left.
