This ulcer had a clean base and was\nnot bleeding. There were two adherent clots adjacent to the\nulcer, one proximal and one distal. The distal clot was removed\nwith aggressive washing and suctioning, and no underlying lesion\ncould be identified. The proximal clot remained adherent despite\naggressive washing. One endoclip was successfully applied to the\nproximal adherent clot for the purpose of hemostasis.\n\n[**2192-12-20**] Flexible Sigmoidoscopy: The previously seen single\npedunculated 2 cm polyp was found in the distal sigmoid colon at\n20cm.

She was put on a heparin gtt, plavix and aspirin\n325mg.  SHe was transfused for a low hct. Her pain resolved and\nshe was started on sips with close monitoring.  On [**11-24**] her\npain increased and she had a stat CTA which showed an unchanged\nappearance of SMA thrombus and no direct or indirect evidence of\nmesenteric ischemia. She was then pre-op'd and consented and\ntaken to the angio suite where she had:\n1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of left brachial artery.\n2. Catheterization of aorta.\n3. Abdominal aortogram with mesenteric angiography.\n4. Selective catheterization of superior mesenteric artery.\n5. Balloon angioplasty and stent of proximal superior\n    mesenteric artery.\n\nAt completion of the procedure, upon  removal of the wire, it\nwas noted there was extensive clot seen on the wire.  The\npatient had been receiving full heparin drip and was fully\nanticoagulated as well as having a therapeutic INR on Coumadin,\nas well as being on full-dose aspirin and Plavix prior to the\npresentation in the operating room.  This led to our decision to\nnot rebolus her with more heparin.  However, due to the nature\nof the clot that was seen on the wire upon exchange to the\n5-French short sheath, and then upon attempt to flush the short\nsheath we were not able to draw back, there was significant\nconcern for a clot in the brachial\nartery.  We therefore did a: Brachial artery cutdown with\nthrombectomy and primary repair.  ACS then did an exploratory\nlaparoscopy and found no evidence of bowel ischemia. Their ports\nwere closed and the patient was monitored closely.  She had\nrespiratory distress and was re-intubated and taken to the\nCVICU. Given her hypercoaguable state, heme was involved and she\nwas started on an argatroban gtt. She was extubated on [**11-25**] and\ndid well. She was transfused again for a falling hct. She\nremained hemodynamicaly stable and was transfered to the VICU\nand [**Month/Day (4) 8337**] a clear diet on [**11-25**].  She continued to make steady\nprogress , tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and voiding\nwhen her foley was removed. Her coumadin was restarted with an\nINR goal of 3.0-3.5 .  She continued to make progress but on [**12-2**]\nreported seeing blood on her toilet paper, after a bowel\nmovement and was found to be guiac positive. Her h/h had fallen\nand she was transfused for a hct of 25 on [**12-3**]. She responded\nappropriately but on [**12-4**] her hct was down to 25.1.  She\nreceived 1 unit prbc without much of a response and got another\n1 unit. By this point she was having melena and her hct\ncontinued to fall. GI was consulted on [**12-4**]. She was prepped\nappropriately and had an EGD on [**12-5**] which showed erosive\ngastritis in the stomach body and antrum. Then on [**12-6**] she had\ncolonoscopy which showed a 20 mm polyp which was treated with an\nendoloop. Her h/h was stable for several days, and her INR was\ntherapeutic and discharge planning was initiated.  On [**12-11**], her\nhct was drifting down. She was transfused appropriately but\ndidn't respond appropriately. She was still having melena.  GI\nwas monitoring the patient.  Her surgical issues were stable and\nthe decision was made to transfer the patient to the medicine\nteam for further monitoring and treatment.\n\nOn [**12-14**], we were called to the bedside by night merit team for\npersistent hypotension to the 70s. Reviewing vitals flowsheets\nplaces her BP in the 100 systolic range, though she repeatedly\ndropped into the upper 80s throughout the day.  As of 2300, her\nBP slipped into the 70s, though she continued to mentate\nnormally without lightheadedness, chest pain or pressure. She\nhas been having daily melenotic stools for the past few days.\nHer bp meds were stopped and she received a liter of NS and her\nfourth pRBC transfusion of the day with improvement of her SBP\nto 100-105.  After consulting with GI, decision made to transfer\nto MICU6 for endoscopy in the AM.  She has undergone 18 red cell\ntransfusions this admission. Her current INR was 4.3. In the\nMICU, the patient continued to have melena, but otherwise\nhemodynamically stable. An EGD was performed that showed\nfriability and erythema of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.\nCautery was used to stop bleeding from the duodenal bulb. After\nEGD, the patient cotninued to have melena. She was maintained on\nher coumadin, plavix, aspirin, and heparin. The patient was then\ntransfered to the VICU for further management.\n\nMs. [**Known lastname 6515**] remained hemodynamically stable following transfer to\nthe VICU. Her hematocrit was routinely monitored and she was\ntransfused as needed for Hcts in the low - mid 20s.  Given the\npersistence of her melena, however, she underwent flexible\nsigmoidoscopy and EGD on [**2192-12-20**], the results of which were\nnotable only for a nonbleeding polyp in the sigmoid colon\n(previously seen on prior [**Last Name (un) **]) as well as some friability of\nthe duodenum which was clipped and injected with epinephrine.\nFollowing this procedure, Ms. [**Known lastname 6515**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] her diet well.\n\nShe was transfered to the [**Last Name (Titles) 1106**] floor where she was monitored\nfor another week. She remained on an argatroban gtt until her\ntrue INR was >3.0 . On [**2192-12-27**] she was stable from a medical and\nsurgical standpoint. Her true INR wasd 3.3 and she was not\nhaving any melena or other GI symptoms.\n\nAt the time of discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 6515**] was hemodynamically stable,\nmentating and ambulating at baseline, and with a stable\nhematocrit. Her INR is therapeutic and she is scheduled for very\nclose monitoring of her h/h and INR with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will also\nhave her BP monitored, and discuss restarting meds with her PCP.\n[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be followed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgery, hematology\nand GI.
