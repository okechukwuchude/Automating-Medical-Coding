Her initial O2 sat was unable to be read in triage, then\nin the room, was in the low 80s, and improved to 92% on NRB.\nGiven that she had barely any air movement, she was started on\nBiPAP.  After about 25 mins of BiPAP, her ABG was 7.27/102/72.\nHer FiO2 was decreased to 35% because she was having apneic\nepisodes, and with that, her repeat ABG was 7.34/79/57.

Small bilateral pleural effusions are again\nseen.\n\n[**2167-5-17**]\nWithin that limitation, there is suggestion of a left basilar\nopacity. Small\nbilateral pleural effusions are new compared to [**2167-4-15**].\nCalcified granulomas\nin bilateral lungs are unchanged. The lungs are hyperinflated,\nas before. The\ncardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pulmonary\nvasculature are\nnot significantly changed. Osseous structures are grossly\nunchanged including\nthe old right clavicular fracture and loss of height in mid\nthoracic vertebral\nbody.\n\nIMPRESSION: Limited study as above. Left basilar opacity\nsuggested\nwhich may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia. There are\nsmall bilateral\npleural effusions, new since [**2167-4-15**].
