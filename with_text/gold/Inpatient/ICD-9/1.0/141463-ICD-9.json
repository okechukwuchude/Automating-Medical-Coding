On arrival your\nblood counts were found to be low. Gastroenterologists were\nconsulted and they performed an endoscopy to look for a source\nof bleed. During the procedure a gastric ulcer was found an\nclipped. Biopsies were taken and testing was sent to look for an\ninfection known as H.pylori. Testing for H.pylori returned\npositive and you were started on Antibiotics and a PPI to treat\ninfection. Infection should resolve with 2 weeks of treatment.\nDuring the course of your stay you received several units of\nblood and your counts improved and at the time of discharge\ncounts were stable.\nDue to the bleed, your anticoagulation was held. At time of\ndischarge aspirin 81mg was restarted. However, warfarin was not\nrestarted at time of discharge due to risk of bleeding. However\ndue to your high risk for stroke you will need additional\nanticoagulation in the future.\nOf note, you will need to follow up with GI for repeat endoscopy\nin 8weeks\n\nChanges to your medications:\n\nStart:\nPantoprazole 40mg PO, take one pill by mouth twice daily until\nyour endoscopy in 8weeks\nAmoxicillin, take four 250mg pills by mouth twice daily for\n14days\nClarithromycin take two 250mg tablets by mouth twice daily for\n14days\n\nStop:\nCoumadin\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nWill follow-up with internist office on Tuesday [**9-28**]\nWill need GI follow-up in 8weeks.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2172-9-24**]"
