Please\n evaluate for an acute process.\n\n COMPARISON:  CT scan from [**2130-8-30**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the abdomen and\n pelvis before and after the injection of IV contrast.  In addition, enteric\n contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also\n available for review.  Total exam DLP is 606.27.\n\n FINDINGS:  The visualized lower lungs reveal mild bibasilar atelectasis.\n\n Since the prior examination, the gallbladder, distal pancreas, and spleen have\n been removed.  The liver enhances homogeneously without focal mass.  The\n common bile duct measures up to 7.5 mm, presumably related to the recent\n surgery.  As on the prior examination, there are at least three walled off\n collections in the pancreas that probably represent hematomas and are slightly\n smaller from prior exam.  The pancreatic duct is normal.  The remaining\n pancreas is atrophic without calcifications.\n\n Multiple hypodensities are seen in both kidneys that are too small to\n adequately characterize but likely represent cysts.  The largest is in the\n upper pole of the left kidney and measures up to 1 cm.  The kidneys otherwise\n enhance symmetrically with symmetric excretion of contrast.  No adrenal nodule\n is identified.\n\n There is a Foley catheter in a mildly distended bladder.  Air within the\n bladder lumen is presumably iatrogenic from Foley catheter placement.\n Multiple fluid-filled structures posterior to the uterine body are more\n apparent on the current examination.  The largest measures up to 3.4 x 2.8 cm.\n These likely are related to the patient's ovaries representing ovarian cysts.\n There is some free fluid in the pelvis.\n\n Oral contrast is seen extending to the hepatic flexure.  There is a\n jejunostomy tube extending into a small bowel loop through the left anterior\n abdominal wall.  There is a 4 x 1.2 cm well circumscribed indurated fat\n structure along the left lateral aspect of the omentum consistent with an\n omental infarct.\n\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2131-2-10**] 3:37 PM\n CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS                 Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 68072**]\n Reason: ? acute process; ct abdomen/pelvis w/ and w/o PO and IV cont\n Admitting Diagnosis: DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n The portal vein and SMV are patent.  The splenic vein is no longer visualized,\n presumably secondary to the recent surgery.  The celiac axis, SMA, and renal\n arteries are patent.  There is a venous catheter with its tip in the left\n external iliac vein.\n\n No osseous abnormalities are identified.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Omental infarct along the left lateral aspect of the abdomen.  Clinically\n correlate with the patient's pain.\n\n 2.  The patient is status post distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and\n cholecystectomy.\n\n 3.  At least three walled off collections are again seen in the pancreas which\n probably represent chronic hematomas and are slightly smaller.  No evidence\n for chronic pancreatitis.\n\n 4.  Mild dilation of the common bile duct.  MRCP may be performed to further\n evaluate.\n\n These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9217**] via telephone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 874**] on\n [**2131-2-10**].\n\n"

Patient was found\nto have pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n1. Diabetic ketoacidosis: In the ED, she was found to have\nelevated blood glucose to 900s and to be in DKA.  Her anion gap\nwas 31. She was started on an Insulin drip and IV fluids.  In\nthe ICU she was continued on the insulin drip and her anion gap\nclosed within 12 hours.  She was ruled out for MI. No infectious\netiology of hyperglycemia was found (had urine culture with\n10,000-100,000 colonies of gram positive alpha hemolytic\ncolonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus\nsp). Pt was not treated for UTI as it was felt that this was a\ncontaminant.  She denied insulin noncompliance or recent drug\nabuse. Mental status was stable and not obtunded  Anion gap\nclosed with insulin drip and IV fluids (8-10 liters). On\nhospital Day # 2 tolerated orals and was transitioned to SC\nInsulin.\n\n2. Pancreatitis: Patient was found to have elevated lipase to\n913 on admission and diffuse abdominal tenderness.  Surgery was\nconsulted and recommended CT scan, which did not any changes\nexcept for omental infarct in the left upper abdomen (nothing to\ndo for this as per surgery).  No surgical intervention was\nrecommended. Surgery followed patient throughout\nhospitalization.  She was able to tolerate a regular diet in\naddition to her tube feeds.\n\nPatient was controlled with IV morphine in the ICU.  When\npatient tolerated PO, her pain medication was changed to\noxycodone.  Patient was discharged with several days of\noxycodone as she continued to have some abdominal pain at\ndischarge.\n\n3. Hyperglycemia: When tube feeds were restarted, hyperglycemia\nwas a problem for patient.  [**Last Name (un) **] consulted. Glargine insulin\nwas increased from 12 [**Hospital1 **] to 34 [**Hospital1 **] at discharge.  Given tube\nfeeding, patient was changed from humalog insulin sliding scale\nto regular insulin sliding scale.\n\n4. Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to pancreatitis. No other\nlocalizing symptoms of infection.  Improved throughout admission\nand was 13 at last check prior to discharge.  Patient should\nhave her CBC checked next week at visit with her PCP.\n\nCHRONIC INACTIVE ISSUES:\n1. Hypertension: Normotensive. Continued clonidine.\n\n2. Chronic pain: Worse than typical pain in setting of acute\npancreatitis. Continued fentanyl patch, gabpentin, tizanidine.\nPatient received Oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1. Repeat CBC in one week as patient had elevated WBC count\nthroughout hospitalization.\n2. Patient instructed to track finger stick glucose and insulin\nrequirement.
