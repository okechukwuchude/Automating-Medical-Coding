Cardiac\nsurgery was consulted and he was scheduled for surgery the\nfollowing day. He had further angina the night before surgery so\nan IABP was placed. He was brought to the operating room on\n[**2172-9-25**] for coronary bypass grafting, please see operative report\nfor details. In summary he had: coronary bypass grafting x3 with\nleft internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,\nreverse saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery and\nreverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery. His\nbypass time was 81 minutes with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.\nHe tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the\ncardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.  He was transfused\nmultiple units of packed red blood cells for bleeding in the\nimmediate post-op period.  He initially required hemodynamic\nsupport with IABP, Levophed and Vasopressin.  Drips and IABP\nwere weaned and the patient was extubated on POD 2.  He\ndeveloped post-op a-fib and was started on amiodarone.  He has a\nhistory of thrombus and coumadin was resumed.  He was noted to\nhave a small amount of sternal drainage and was started on\nKefzol.  Drainage resolved and he will not be discharged on\nantibiotics.\nBeta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed\ntoward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to\nthe telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and\npacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The\npatient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge\non POD 10 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was\nhealing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The\npatient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with\nappropriate follow up instructions.
