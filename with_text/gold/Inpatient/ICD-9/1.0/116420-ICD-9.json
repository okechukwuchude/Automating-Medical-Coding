Selective coronary angiography in this\nright dominant system demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was\npatent. The LAD had diffuse plaquing throughout and tapers to\n90% beyond the patent proximal to mid LAD stent and the D2\ntakeoff. The D2 is diffusely diseased with 40% at ostium and 50%\nproximally. The D1 is a substantive bifricating vessel with 70%\nostial stenosis (partially jailed by the LAD stent). The LCx had\nmild plaquing throughout. The proximal OM1 and mid OM2 (both\nsmall vessels) have focal 70% stenosis with normal flow. The RCA\nwas subselectively engaged due to ostial stent and\ncalcifications. The ostial stent was patent with instent\nrestenosis (mild, nonflow-limiting). Serial focal stenosis (1st\n65-70%) just beyond the acute marginal takeoff and second (90%)\nabout 2 cm downstream. The PL has 70-80% ostially but overall\nthis is a small diffusely diseased vessel. The R-PDA is patent.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated\nsystemic arterial systolic pressures with an SBP of 150 mmHg. 3.\nAbdominal aortography was performed using a pigtail catheter via\npower injection and showed diffuse plaquing in the infra-renal\naorta, possible moderate L renal artery stenosis, calcific right\ncommon iliac artery stenosis (difficulty passing the wire\nthrough the common iliac into the aorta).\n.\n[**2142-1-3**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA no\nstenosis.\n.\n[**2142-1-4**] Echo: Pre-CPB: The patient is in A.Fib. No spontaneous\necho contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left\nventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The\nright ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free\nwall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There\nare complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There\nis moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). In\nthe face of more modest peak and mean gradients across the\nvalve, a discussion led to the decision to not replace it. Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 4901**] offered his opinion also. Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild\n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial\neffusion. Post-CPB: The patient is on an AV-Pacer, though there\nis no atrial response. No inotropes. Preserved biventricular\nsystolic fxn. 1+MR, trace AI. Aorta intact.\n.\n[**2142-1-9**] WBC-10.4 RBC-3.14* Hgb-9.3* Hct-27.7* MCV-89 MCH-29.6\nMCHC-33.5 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-308\n[**2141-12-31**] WBC-11.5* RBC-4.95 Hgb-14.6 Hct-43.0 MCV-87 MCH-29.6\nMCHC-34.0 RDW-13.0 Plt Ct-205\n[**2142-1-9**] Glucose-136* UreaN-23* Creat-1.0 Na-140 K-4.5 Cl-103\nHCO3-32\n[**2141-12-31**] Glucose-172* UreaN-21* Creat-0.9 Na-141 K-4.4 Cl-106\nHCO3-22\n[**2142-1-3**] ALT-27 AST-29 LD(LDH)-260* AlkPhos-61 TotBili-0.4\n\nMicro:\n[**2142-1-3**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2142-1-4**]):    <10,000\norganisms/ml.\nMRSA SCREEN NASAL SWAB. MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2142-1-6**]):    No MRSA\nisolated\n\nPICC line [**2141-1-7**]:\nRight jugular line has been removed. Tip of the new right PIC\nline is in the right atrium. It should be withdrawn 3.5 cm to\nposition it low in the SVC.\nMild pulmonary edema has developed, most readily appreciated in\nthe right\nlower lung. Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding, but mediastinal\nand hilar\nvascular engorgements have worsened. There is greater\nconsolidation at the\nleft lung base, presumably atelectasis though pneumonia is not\nexcluded, and an increase in small-to-moderate left pleural\neffusion. There is no\npneumothorax.\n\nCXR: [**2142-1-6**] There is a questionable tiny left pneumothorax.\nThe pulmonary edema has almost resolved. There are persistent\nlow lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal\nsilhouette is unchanged. Right IJ catheter remains low in the\nright atrium and can be withdrawn 3-4 cm for more standard\nposition. If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.\nThe sternal wires are aligned.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nAs mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 47059**] was transferred from\noutside hospital with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He\nunderwent a cardiac cath on [**1-1**] which revealed severe three\nvessel coronary artery disease. He then underwent appropriate\nsurgical work-up while awaiting Plavix to wash-out. On [**1-4**] he\nwas brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary\nartery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative note for surgical\ndetails. Following surgery he was transferred to the CIVCU for\ninvasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was\nweaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.\nOn post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and diuretics\nand diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day two he\nwas transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest\ntubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On\npost-op day three he had episode of rapid atrial fibrillation\nIV/PO amiodarone was started. He converted to sinus rhythm\n(pre-op history of AF but not on Coumadin d/t hemorrhagic\nstroke). A Non-heparin PICC line was placed for IV access.  His\nFoley was removed and a condom cath was placed for incontinence.\nHe was bladder scanned for 300.  He continued to make good\nprogress while working with physical therapy. On post-op day 5\nhe was discharged to rehab with the appropriate medications and\nfollow-up appointments.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications at home:\nmetoprolol tartarte 50mg [**Hospital1 **]\nlisinopril 10mg daily\nsimvastatin 20mg daily\ntamsulosin 0.4mg daily\nescitalopram 20mg daily\nfinasteride 4mg\nsenna-docunsate 1 tab TID\nNPH/Novolin 10 units SC daily\nNPH 15 units SC at dinner\nascorbic acid 500mg daily\nfolic acid-vit b2-vit b6-vit b 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]\nergocalciferol 1000 units daily\ntrazodone 50mg daily\naspirin 81mg daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
