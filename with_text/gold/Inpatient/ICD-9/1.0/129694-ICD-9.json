Discussed with\n   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new\n   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer\n   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of\n   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that\n   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at\n   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach\n   since admission.\n   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.\n   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV\n   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400\n   mg twice daily\n   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.\n   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or\n   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.\n   # Hypoxia:\n   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume\n   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly\n   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA\n   - Diuresis when able.\n   - Wean O2 as tolerated.\n   .\n   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:\n   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.\n   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.\n   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues\n   resolve.\n   .\n   # Leukocytosis.\n   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection\n   vs. hematopatholgy.\n   - Cover with vancomycin for now.\n   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.\n   # PVD with recent revascularization.\n   - Vascular following.\n   - Will continue vanco with concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal\n   ulcer.\n   # Sacral decubitus.\n   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.\n   # CAD\n   - ASA, statin, BB\n   # CKD.

Mild cardiomegaly\npersists. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are\nnoted. There is diffuse hazy bilateral reticular opacity with\n[**Last Name (un) 16765**] A and B lines. There is no focal consolidation or\npneumothorax.\nIMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.\n.\nCXR [**3-9**]\nIn comparison with the study of [**3-7**], there is increasing\nprominence of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary\nedema and bilateral pleural effusions. The change in heart size\nraises the possibility of underlying pericardial effusion.\nPacemaker leads remain in place. Retrocardiac opacification most\nlikely is consistent with atelectasis, though supervening\npneumonia cannot be\nunequivocally excluded.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is an 84 year old male with history of PVD status-post\nrecent axillobifemoral grafting with course complicated by wide\ncomplex tachycardia; now admitted to MICU after getting multiple\nnodal agents for VT at rehab.\n\n# Ventricular tachycardia:\nThe patient has had previous Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). On\nthis admission, he presented with a wide complex VT which is\ndifferent from his previous VT. Cardiology followed the patient\nat arrival to MICU. The reason for recurrence of VT is unclear:\nnew ischemia, stretch from volume overload, or possibly further\ndisruption of pacer leads leading to more irritation of\nventricle. The patient did have an episode of asymptomatic\nventricular tachycardia on night of admission that spontaneously\naborted. He also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at time of that\nventricular tachycardic episode. He had a repeat episode of VT\non [**3-9**] in the morning. He was given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1,\nLidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to sinus rhythm via\npatient??????s AICD. He was started on Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] with\nplans to titrate this medication per Cardiology. He had another\nepisode of VT on the morning of [**3-10**] which converted with\nanother bolus of amiodarone 150 mg IV. He did not have any\nfurther episodes of VT since then.\nHe was continued on oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily, his\nelectrolytes (magnesium and potassium) were repleted\naggressively.\nAccording to Cardiology, he is not a candidate for lead\nreplacement, and should be medically managed. This is also in\nline with the patient and his family's wishes to avoid\naggressive care. (The patient is DNR/DNI, and moving towards\ncomfort care, although not at officially comfort care only). TTE\non [**3-9**] showed slightly increased EF (25-30%), slightly\ndecreased left ventricular cavity size and slightly worse mitral\nregurg. Amiodarone dosing should be adjusted as follows:\nAmiodarone 400 mg twice a day for one more week (through [**3-18**]), then 200 mg twice a day for two weeks ([**3-19**] through\n[**4-1**]), then 200 mg once a day indefinitely.\n.\n# Hypotension:\nPossible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given\nleukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers),\ncardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF; less likely\npericardial effusion), most likely med related (multiple\nnodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia). Lactate was\nnot elevated. Vancomycin was discontinued after 48 hours with\ncontinued negative culture data; he remained afebrile. His ACEI\nand alpha blockers were held; he was continued on low dose beta\nblock given arrhythmia as BPs tolerate. Pt remained 110s-130s\nsystolic since transfer out of MICU on [**3-10**].\n.\n# Hypoxia:\nHe was on a non-rebreather (NRB) in the ED but easily\ntransitioned to nasal cannula (NC) in ICU.  This was likely\nvolume overload related. He also has a history of COPD. He was\nsatting 99-100% on RA, although he did have increased wheezing\nand dyspnea over the night of admission without relief with\nnebs. He was given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.\nSteroids and nebulizers were discontinued and goal even to\nnegative fluid balance was maintained with PRN IV Lasix. Lasix\nwas held since [**3-10**] due to mild elevation of creatinine. Pt\nmaintained O2 sats in mid-upper 90s on RA-2L via NC.\n.\n# Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on\nchronic:\nThe patient had elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.\nHis beta-blocker dose was increased over the night of admission\nand continued as pressures tolerated. His ACEI was held for\nhypotension. His I/Os were also targeted for a net diuresis with\nPRN Lasix. Again, lasix was held since [**3-10**] and remained net\neven since then. Pt remained stable from respiratory\nperspective.
