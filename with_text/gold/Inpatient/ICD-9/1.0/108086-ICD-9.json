The patient was recently admission for hypercalcemia,\nacute renal failure and a large left pleural effusion. A Pleurex\ncatheter was placed during that admission but was removed prior\nto discharge. The patient stated that he was home from rehab for\napproximately one week and felt as if he was getting his\nstrength back. Two days prior to admission the patient stated\nthat he began to feel short of breath when working with his\nphysical therapist. He remained home until the next evening when\na friend took him to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **] because he felt he could no\nlonger catch his breath. He was immediately transferred here. He\ndenied any recent fevers or chills, chest pain or dizziness. He\nfurther denied any nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea.\n.\nIn the ER, VS were T 98.5, BP 125/70, HR 120, but his HR came\ndown to 90, RR 20 and saturations to 95% after the patient was\nplaced on 3L of O2 by nasal canula. A CXR was performed that was\nconcerning for bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nPast Medical History:\nPAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:\n- began to have fatigue, dizziness and flu symptoms in [**Month (only) 404**]\n[**2180**]\n- on routine visit in [**Month (only) 116**], found to have RUQ mass\n- CT abd/pelvis on [**2180-6-24**] showed a large exophytic mass in R\nkidney, 9.6 x 9.3 cm, with associated abdominal lymphadenopathy\nand pulmonary metastasis\n- CT chest showed diffuse pulmonary metastases\n- CT guided needle biopsy of the kidney on [**2180-7-17**] showed high\ngrade carcinoma, favoring renal cell cancer, with necrosis\n- enrolled in protocol 04-117: Tumor/DC fusion in patients with\nRenal Cell Carcinoma on [**2180-8-16**]\n- s/p R laparoscopic radical nephrectomy on [**2180-9-5**]\n- path showed clear cell renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid\nfeatures (60%), [**Last Name (un) 19076**] grade [**5-14**], with extension into\nperinephric fat (T3a, N0, M1); margins clear, LVI indeterminate\n\n- post-surgical CT showed rapid disease progression and he was\ntaken off study on [**2180-10-9**]\n- Completed recent two week course of Sutent and is currently\ntaking two weeks off\n.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n# Hypercholesterolemia\n# Bilateral shoulder and hand surgery\n\nSocial History:\nHe is divorced, lives and works on [**Hospital3 **] as an electrician.\nHe quit smoking at age 51, one pack per week x15 years.\nPreviously drank 1-2 drinks several times per week, but none in\nlast 1-2 weeks due to feeling ill. No recreational drug use.\n\nFamily History:\nNegative for kidney, prostate or bladder cancer. Father has CAD,\nbut is alive and well.\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nAt admission:\nVS: T 96.4, BP 130/72, HR 104, R 18, sats 95% on 2L\nGEN: uncomfortable appearing, laboring to breath but NAD\nHEENT: sclera anicteric, dry mucus membranes, no nasal flaring\nNECK: no cervical LAD, no JVD\nCV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1, S2, no m/r/g\nLUNGS: decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, left\nworse than right, dullness to percussion\nABD: S/NT/ND, BS+\nEXT: warm, well-perfused, no palpable cords, no TTP\nNEURO: CN II-XII grossly intact, moving all extremities,\nsensation to light touch in tact\n\nPertinent Results:\nAt admission:\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:20AM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-4.05* Hgb-12.6* Hct-36.5*\nMCV-90 MCH-31.2 MCHC-34.6 RDW-19.6* Plt Ct-248#\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:20AM BLOOD Neuts-80* Bands-4 Lymphs-12* Monos-3\nEos-1 Baso-0 Atyps-0 Metas-0 Myelos-0\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:20AM BLOOD PT-12.1 PTT-25.2 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:20AM BLOOD Glucose-103* UreaN-17 Creat-0.9 Na-136\nK-4.8 Cl-103 HCO3-24 AnGap-14\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:20AM BLOOD Albumin-3.2* Calcium-10.9* Phos-2.6*\nMg-1.8\n[**2180-12-3**] 02:06PM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-84* pCO2-46* pH-7.43\ncalTCO2-32* Base XS-4\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:34AM BLOOD Lactate-2.5*\n[**2180-12-2**] 01:36AM URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG\nGlucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-7.0 Leuks-NEG\n\nOn Discharge:\n[**2180-12-7**] 05:46AM BLOOD WBC-4.8 RBC-3.26* Hgb-10.2* Hct-29.3*\nMCV-90 MCH-31.4 MCHC-34.9 RDW-18.8* Plt Ct-326\n[**2180-12-7**] 05:46AM BLOOD Glucose-90 UreaN-23* Creat-0.9 Na-131*\nK-5.2* Cl-96 HCO3-27 AnGap-13\n[**2180-12-7**] 05:46AM BLOOD Calcium-9.9 Phos-2.1* Mg-2.0\n\n\nBlood cultures 10/23, no growth as of [**12-7**]\n\nCTA chest [**12-2**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Progression of multiple bilateral pulmonary metastatic\nlesions.\n2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n3. Progression of right adrenal, likely metastatic lesion.\n\n[**12-5**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-4**],\nthere is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral\npulmonary opacifications consistent with multiple pulmonary\nmetastases apparently complicated by a pulmonary edema or\nhemorrhage. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists and\nthere is mediastinal widening reflecting diffuse adenopathy.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 4711**] is a 51 year old male with stage IV clear cell\nrenal carcinoma with known lung mets who presented with\nworsening shortness of breath and hypoxia.\n\n# Dyspnea, Hypoxia - Patient initially required 2L O2 to\nmaintain O2 sats 94%.  CTA chest on admission was negative for\nPE.  By hospital day two he required 4L by nasal canula.  A\nthoracentesis was attempted, but there was insufficient fluid to\ntap.  On hospital day 3 he triggered for O2 sat of 86% on 4L\nnasal canula and was increased to 6L nasal canula and then\ntransferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and placed on a\nface tent.  Chest x-ray demonstrated worsening bilateral patchy\nopacities.  He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for\n48 hours (vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and bactrim),\nhowever, his respiratory status failed to improve and cultures\nremained negative so antibiotics were stopped.  He did not\ntolerate oral bactrim due to nausea.  His hypoxia and dyspnea\nare most likely secondary to his widespread pulmonary metastatic\ndisease.  He was given morphine and nebs to treat his dyspnea\nand guiafenesin with codeine and benzonatate for cough.\n\n#. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  He recently completed a\ncycle of Sutent.  The patient was continued on dexamethasone per\nhis outpatient regimen which was initiated at the time of his\nwhole brain radiation.  It is unclear if he is continuing to\nderive benefit from this medication so consideration to stopping\nthis medication can be given.  As he has been on this medication\nfor almost a month, it will need to be tapered before stopping\ncompletely.  He has stage 4 disease with poor prognosis.  There\nare no further treatment options per the patient's oncologist.\nAfter discussion with his oncologist following transfer to the\nICU the patient changed his code status to DNR/DNI.  Palliative\ncare was consulted and made [**Known lastname 7219**] for symptom\nmanagement including dyspnea, nausea, and insomnia.  He is being\ndischarged to inpatient hospice for further symptom management\nand due to his high oxygen requirement.\n\n#. Hypercalcemia:  Patient was noted to have elevated calcium on\npresentation.  He was given IVF and lasix and calcium remained\nelevated.  He was also treated with a dose of pamidronate and\ncalcitonin.\n\n# Hyperkalemia: The patient had intermittently elevated serum\npotassiums that peaked at 5.2.  Etiology is unclear but may be\nsecondary to dexamethasone or tumor burden causing increased\nlactate due to increased metabolic demand.  There was no\nevidence of renal failure or acidemia.\n\n#.
