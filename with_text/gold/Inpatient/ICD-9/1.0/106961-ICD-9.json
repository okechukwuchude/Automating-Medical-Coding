HYPONATREMIA: Etiology was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in\nthe setting of over-aggressive diuretic use and decreased\ndietary intake of sodium.  Patient had started dieting, eating\nless salt and drinking more water.  He presented with\nhypotension and tachycardia.  Patient also presented with acute\nkidney injury, elevated lactate, fractional excretion of sodium\nless than 1, low urine sodium, and elevated creatinine and BUN\nall suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia as the etiology. While\nin the MICU his sodium was corrected with normal saline and his\nurine and serum sodium trended. Once his sodium was trending\nupward he was transferred to the medicine floor.  His torsemide\nwas held and then restarted on [**8-7**] on an every other day dosing\nschedule, and he should follow up with his PCP for repeat lab\ntesting.\n\n# HYPOTENSION / TACHYCARDIA - Though initially concerned for\nSIRS/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possible\nsource of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasis\nulcers.  CXR, UA, blood cultures were all negative for signs of\ninfection.  He did not have fever of systemic signs of\ninfection.  Initially he met systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome criteria with a possible source. He was started on\nvancomycin and unasyn empirically. On re-evaluation he remained\nafebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis.\nHis vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kept\non per his vascular physicians prescription. Hypotension was\nlikely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the setting\nof overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactive\ntachycardia.  Metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held for\nhypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  He\nwas monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrial\nfibrillation with RVR.  However, he had asymptomatic sinus\ntachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  This was\nlikely because his home medications were held, and his\ntachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, and\ndiltiazem at his home doses.  Torsemide was restarted on an\nevery other day dosing schedule.\n\n#. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Chronic issue. On coumadin, metoprolol,\ndiltizem, and digoxin at home. In the MICU, he became mildly\nhypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so his\nmetoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  Upon trasnfer to\nfloor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcations\nand metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia,\nparticularly with exertion with PT. He should follow up with his\nPCP regarding titration of his rate control. His INR was\nsubtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. Digoxin\nwas continued and level was not toxic.\n\n#. Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal and related to\nhypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improved\nwith holding torsemide and administration of IVF. His creatine\nand BUN were trended and his creatine trended downward with IV\nfluids.\n\n#. STASIS DERMATITIS WITH POSSIBLE SUPER IMPOSED CELLULITIS:\nWhile in the MICU he did not spike a fever or appear overtly\nseptic by exam or review of systems. His leukocytosis\nnormalized. The decision was made to leave him on his outpatient\ndose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascular\nphysician.\n\n#. CIRRHOSIS: This is a diagnosis that is currently undergoing\noutpatient workup. He did not appear hypervolemic and this was\nnot likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. He\ndenies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing a\nliver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. His\nliver function was monitored while in the MICU and remained\nstable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis was\nperformed.\n\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up.\n-Should f/u with PCP regarding torsemide dosing which was\ndecreased to every other day.  He should be evaluated for less\naggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine.\n-He should follow up with his PCP and cardiology regarding\ntitration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.\n-Warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his INR was 1.4\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from [**Month/Year (2) 581**].\n1. Warfarin 2 mg PO DAILY16\n2. Torsemide 50 mg PO DAILY\n3. OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO BID:PRN pain\n4. Metoprolol Succinate XL 50 mg PO DAILY\n5. Latanoprost 0.005% Ophth.
