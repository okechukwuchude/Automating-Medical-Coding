The\nsurgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the\nprocedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.\n\nPostoperative course was remarkable for the following:\n\n1. ICU Course:\n# s/p left hip replacement:  Patient tolerated the procedure\nwell per Ortho although he did have significant blood loss and\nfluid shifts. He had a RIJ placed in the OR the postition of\nwhich was confirmed on presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Post-op Hct\nstable at 33.2. He received ancef for 24 hours after the\nprocedure. Was intubated on admission to unit. He was cautiously\nweaned from the vent and from Propofol given his prior history\nof difficulty with extubation and altered mental status. Opiods\nwere avoided in management of the patient's pain. He was given\nsmall fentanyl boluses for pain through the night. He was\nextubated in the morning without difficulty. The JP drains\ncontained serosanginous fluid, and on POD1 the patient was\nstarted on enoxaparin 40mg Sc daily. Pain management was an\nissue given the patient's underlying hepatic dysfunction. The\nacute pain and the chronic pain services were consulted\nregarding a lumbosacral block. It was decided that in place of a\nlumbosacral block, the patient's Dilaudid PCA would be increased\nto dose to .24/6m and his long-acting oxycontin PO 10 mg Q6H.\nThe patient was successfully extubated upon leaving the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].\n.\n# EtOH Cirrhosis - Blood transfusions and insult of surgery\nwould contribute to higher likelihood of post-op hepatic\nencephalopathy.  Patient does have history of grade 1 varices as\nwell. Mental status was monitored through [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course and the\npatient did not have hepatic encephalopathy on exam. Lactulose\nwas started after the patient was extubated. His home nadolol\nwas initially held [**1-7**] low BP, but this was restarted after\nextubation.\n.\n# Pancytopenia - History of thrombocytopenia [**1-7**] cirrhosis as\nwell as pancytopenia, (which on previous workup by Heme/Onc was\nfelt to medication, portal sequestration).  Macrocytic anemia\nconsistent with history of alcohol and cirrhosis. CBC was\nmonitored with a goal of keeping platelets > 10 or 50 if acute\nbleeding. Through his course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient had an\nactive type and screen. No transfusions were required\npost-operatively in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].\n.\n# Crohn's disease - Stable, not having diarrhea. Continued with\nazathioprine when taking POs.\n.\n# HTN - Initially held lisinopril for now pending fluid shifts\nand post op hypotension.\n.\n# COPD - Documented h/o COPD in OMR but on no home medications.\n\n# Ascending aortic aneurysm: Stable on recent Echo. VS were\nmonitored.\n.\n# Depression: Home duloxitine was continued.\n\n2. Asymptomatic post-operative anemia - POD 2 Hct 21.1 ->\nTransfused 2 units PRBCs\n\n3. Medicine consult for co-management\n\nOtherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by\na transition to oral pain medications on POD#2.  The patient\nreceived lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of\nPOD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was\nvoiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was\nchanged on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean\nand intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient\nwas seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout\nthe hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of\ndischarge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling\nwell.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The\npatient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately\ncontrolled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was\nneurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.\n\nThe patient's weight-bearing status is TOUCHDOWN weight bearing\non the operative extremity with POSTERIOR and TROCHANTER OFF\nprecautions.\n\nMr. [**Known lastname 3265**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:\nAZATHIOPRINE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 50 mg Tablet -\n2-1/2 Tablet(s) by mouth once daily\nDULOXETINE [CYMBALTA] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 60 mg\nCapsule, Delayed Release(E.C.) - one Capsule(s) by mouth daily\nFOLIC ACID -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 1 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth once daily\nLISINOPRIL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 10 mg Tablet -\none\nTablet(s) by mouth daily\nNADOLOL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - one\nTablet(s) by mouth daily\nOXYCODONE [OXYCONTIN] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg\nTablet Extended Release 12 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice daily\nOXYCODONE-ACETAMINOPHEN [ROXICET] -  (Prescribed by Other\nProvider) - 5 mg-325 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 4-6\nhours as needed for pain\nSODIUM CHLORIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) -   - 4 mg\ndaily\nTRAZODONE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 50 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth once a day\n.\nMedications - OTC\nCALCIUM -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage uncertain\nCYANOCOBALAMIN (VITAMIN B-12) [VITAMIN B-12] -  (Prescribed by\nOther Provider) - Dosage uncertain\nMAGNESIUM OXIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 400 mg\nTablet\n- 6 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a day\nMULTIVITAMIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage\nuncertain\nOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [PRILOSEC OTC] -  (Prescribed by Other\nProvider) - 20 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) - two Tablet(s)\nby mouth daily\n.\nMedications on transfer to ICU:\n-Lisinopril 10 mg PO/NG DAILY\n-Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H\n-Milk of Magnesia 30 ml PO BID:PRN Constipation\n-Bisacodyl 10 mg PO/PR DAILY:PRN Constipation\n-Multivitamins 1 CAP PO DAILY\n-CefazoLIN 2 g IV Q8H (2 hrs post-op)\n-Nadolol 40 mg PO DAILY\n-Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO TID\n-OxycoDONE (Immediate Release) 5-10 mg PO Q4H:PRN Pain Start: In\nam\nBegin after PCA has been d/c [**6-24**]\n-Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID\n-Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea/vomiting\n-Duloxetine 60 mg PO DAILY\n-Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY\n-Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg SC DAILY Start: In am\nBegin on [**6-24**] wednesday\n-Senna 1 TAB PO BID\n-FoLIC Acid 1 mg PO/NG DAILY\n-Vitamin D 400 UNIT PO DAILY  Order date: [**6-23**] @ 1103\n-HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 0.12 mg IVPCA Lockout Interval: 6\nminutes Basal Rate: 0 mg(s)/hour 1-hr Max Limit: 1.2 mg(s)\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n2. multivitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Cap PO DAILY (Daily).\n3. duloxetine 30 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
