Pt was seen in clinic on [**2200-1-2**] and was noted to\nbe increasingly hypertensive, for which Lisinopril was increased\nto 40mg daily. Follow up labs were notable for a progressive\nrise in creatinine from 1.5 to 2.9. During this time, Lisinopril\nwas stopped and Glipizide was increased to 15mg [**Hospital1 **].

The estimated right\natrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\nTransmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent\nwith Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The right\nventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nThere is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There\nis no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2193-1-18**], the left ventricle is more\nhypertrophied with increased severity of mitral regurgitation.\n\n[**1-15**] Head CT\nNo evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass.\n\n[**1-15**] Renal US with dopplers\nIMPRESSION: Limited examination. Bilateral brisk systolic\nupstrokes in the\nmain renal arteries at the hilum are present and therefore no\nevidence of renal artery stenosis is present. Blunted systolic\nupstrokes of intrarenal waveforms could reflect parenchymal\nabnormality but cannot be reliably assessed due to limitations\nof the examination. If further evaluation is required then non-\ngadolinium- enhanced MRA may be attempted.\n.\n[**2200-1-18**] CHEST CT W/O CONTRAST\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary nodule or mass.\n2. Cardiomegaly, with coronary artery calcification, as\ndescribed above.\n3. Heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid, with calcifications as\ndescribed above. The patient has not had a thyroid ultrasound at\nthis institution since [**2191**], and if there has not been a recent\nevaluation, repeat assessment is recommended.\n.\n[**2200-1-20**] THYROID U/S\nTHYROID ULTRASOUND: Evaluation is somewhat limited due to\npatient\npositioning. The right lobe measures 7.2 x 4.8 x 3.2 cm. The\nleft lobe\nmeasures 4.8 x 3.22 x 2.9 cm. Both lobes are heterogeneous with\nmultiple\nnodules. Again, nodules range from hyper to hypoechoic and some\nnodules\ncontains cystic areas. The largest nodule is again located in\nthe lower pole of the right lobe, a solid nodule measuring 4.1 x\n2.4 x 3.9 cm. On the left, the largest (spongy) nodule measures\n1.8 x 2.1 x 1 cm. In the isthmus, a mixed cystic and solid\nnodule measures 1.2 x 0.9 x 1.2 cm.\nIMPRESSION: Multinodular goiter. The gland and nodules have\nenlarged since\nthe prior study of [**2191**], although technical differences make\ndirect comparison difficult. The overall appearance is generally\nunchanged with no new dominant nodules or masses.\n.\n[**2200-1-20**] RENAL U/S\nRENAL ULTRASOUND: Both kidneys are slightly increased in\nechogenicity\ndiffusely. The right kidney measures 9.2 cm and the left kidney\nmeasures 10.5 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stones or masses\nof either kidney. Simple cysts are again noted of both kidneys.\nThe largest is located on the left, measuring up to 1.4 cm. The\nurinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter and\nballoon.\nIMPRESSION: Slightly increase in diffuse echogenicity of both\nkidneys,\notherwise no change since renal ultrasound of [**2200-1-15**]. This can\nbe seen in\nchronic renal disease.\n.\n[**2200-1-21**] BONE SCAN\nWhole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and\nposterior\nprojections and demonstrate several areas of increased uptake in\nthe knees, and ankles, consistent with degenerative changes.\nThere is also intense increased uptake in the region of L5 and a\nsmaller region laterally in L4. These are most likely due to\ndegenerative changes, however plain xray or CT imaging of the\nlower lumbar spine may be of assistance for further evaluation,\nif clinically indicated. The remainder of the bony skeleton\nappears normal.  The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized,\nthe normal route of tracer excretion.\nNo prior studies available.\nIMPRESSION: Probable degenerative changes as discussed above. If\n\nhyperparathyroid adenoma is considered as a cause of\nhypercalcemia, suggest nuclear medicine parathyroid scanning.\n.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n#Hypoglycemia - Thought to be due to sulfonylurea therapy in the\nsetting of acute on chronic renal insufficiency. Oral\nhypoglycemics were held. Corrected with dextrose, glucagon, and\nocteotide in the MICU. Patient tolerated the eventual\nreintroduction of basal and sliding scale insulin therapy.\n.\n#Hypertensive Urgency - Remained asymptomatic. Lisinopril had\nbeen discontinued one week prior in the setting of acute on\nchronic renal insufficiency. Initially treated with a\nbetablocker, norvasc, and hydralazine but the former was\nsubsequently held due to bradycardia. HCTZ was held in the\nsetting of hypercalcemia. The home dose of hydralazine was\nincreased to 75 mg QID and imdur was started at a dose of 30 mg\ndaily with subsequent improvement in blood pressure control.\nRenal ultrasound did not reveal evidence of renal artery\nstenosis, consistent with the results of an MRA in [**2195-4-18**].\n.\n# Hypercalcemia: [**Year (4 digits) 32883**] calcium peaked at 12.7 with a peak\nionized calcium of 1.51. The level improved modestly with\naggressive IVF. [**Name (NI) 32883**] PTH was low. Workup for an underlying\ncause was unremarkable, including [**Name (NI) **] cortisol, SPEP/UPEP,\nchest x-ray, non-contrast CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, and\nbone scan. [**Name (NI) 32883**] vitamin D and PTHrP are pending at the time of\ndischarge. She will continue receiving saline infusions at rehab\nto ensure adequate hydration. The importance of adequate oral\nhydration was nonetheless reinforced with the patient and her\nfamily. She will follow up with endocrinology clinic as an\noutpatient.\n.\n#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Creatinine improved from 3.0\nto 1.9 with volume repletion. A new baseline was attributed to\nthe progression of nephropathy as evidenced by diffuse\nechogenicity in both kidneys on ultrasound.\n.\n#Acute uncomplicated cystitis - Treated with ciprofloxacin for 7\ndays.\n.\n#DMII - Oral hypoglycemic agents were held initially in the\nsetting of hypoglycemia and were not restarted due to renal\ninsufficiency. She was started on basal and sliding scale\ninsulin, as above.\n.\n#Thyroid nodule - Chest CT incidentally discovered a\nheterogeneous enlarged thyroid with asymmetric enlargement of\nthe right lobe and coarse calcifications in both lobes. Thyroid\nultrasound revealed multinodular goiter with the largest nodule\nin the lower pole of the right lobe measuring 4.1 x 2.4 x 3.9\ncm.
