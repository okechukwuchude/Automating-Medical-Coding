The patient reports on the morning of presentation\nshe woke up without significant abdominal pain or nausea but did\nnotice her abdomen was very distended.  She then began to vomit\nand had a paroxysm of vomiting where she had five episodes of\nemesis each with about a half cup of dark blood per her report.\nShe called EMS and was brought to an OSH where she had an NG\npassed that expelled a large amount of dark blood.  Reports vary\nand some sources (i.e. ED dash) said this was bright red blood\nbut after reviewing with patient it seems this was all maroon\nwith only flecks of dark red blood.  Unfortunately, she vomited\nout the NG tube.  She was started on octreotide drip and\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  OSH Hct was 36.7.\n\n\n\nIn the ED VS: T 99.4, P 62, BP 122/75, RR 16, O2 97% 3L.  On\narrival to [**Hospital1 18**] Hct was 36.4 and she remained HD stable without\ntachycardia or hypotension.  She was started on pantoprazole\ndrip.  Liver was called and plan to scope patient tomorrow.  She\nwas also started on ceftriaxone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31424**].  She was\nsent to the MICU.\n\nCurrently, she denies any symptoms.  Denies CP, SOB,\nlight-headedness.  She reports abdominal distension leading to\nSOB was worst symptom and this has resolved after having NG.\n\nPast Medical History:\n# Autoimmune hepatitis: [**Doctor First Name **]+, AMA-, [**Last Name (un) 15412**]+\n# Cirrhosis:\n# Rheumatoid Arthritis:\n# Hep C: Genotype 3. most recent viral load undetectable.\n# mulitple liver biopsies\n# compartment syndrome in R arm s/p surgical decompression [**11-24**]\n# herpes zoster\n# C section in [**2175**]\n# osteomyelitis [**2177**]\n# Nephrolithiasis\n\n\nSocial History:\nLives with mother in [**Name (NI) 14663**].\nSmokes 5 cig/day (down from before) x 15 yrs.

She missed 4 days of Lasix doses\nso we will re-initiate her diuretic regimen as well as her other\nhome medications.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n#.  GIB: the patient had dark emesis and a lavage done at OSH\nrevealed blood. On EGD, non-bleeding grade I varices are\nappreciated so unclear if this is source of bleed. We treated as\nfor GIB but we did not continue octreotide and PPI. Treatment\nwith ceftriaxone and converted to po Cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for 7 days,\nNadolol 20mg daily. Patient's hematocrit remained stable around\n33-35 and she remained hemodynamically stable\n.\n#.  Autoimmune Hepatitis c/b cirrhosis, recurrent ascites.\nAbdominal pain may be [**1-19**] ascites. Continued on home dose of\nLasix (of which she had missed 4 days of doses), Aldactone, home\ndose of Imuran, Budesonide. Started on weekly vitamin D 50,000\non Wednesdays. The patient achieved relief of abdominal pain\nwith carafate and was also advised to use Tums for her pain. As\nwell, she was given tramadol for this pain.\n.\n#.Uncomplicated UTI: patient had asymptomic pyuria, urine\ncultures show staph aureus coag positive. Sensitivities revealed\nresistance to levofloxacin and so ciprofloxacin will not cover\nher. She was given a 3 day course of Bactrim for UTI.\n.\n#Patient eloped with 2 IV's in arms. She left without receiving\ndischarge paperwork but Rx were delivered.\n.\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n#. Cirrhosis. MELD was 15 on day of discharge. Patient will\ncontinue to follow in transplant hepatology.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:\nCODE: Full\nCONTACT: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73008**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72764**]\nPENDING STUDIES: none\nPATIENT ELOPED WITH IV'S INTACT.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nImuran 50 mg once a day,\nbudesonide 3 mg one p.o. t.i.d.,\nvitamin D 50,000 units once a  week,\nfurosemide 20 mg once a day,\nspironolactone 100 mg once a  day,\ncalcium with vitamin D is on hold due to kidney stones,\niron 325 one three times a day\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 50,000 unit Capsule Sig: One (1)\nCapsule PO 1X/WEEK (WE).\nDisp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. azathioprine 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n3. budesonide 3 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1)\nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO TID (3 times a day).\n4. furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n5. spironolactone 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n6. ferrous sulfate 300  mg (60 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO TID (3 times a day).\n7. ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H\n(every 12 hours) for 4 days.\nDisp:*8 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n8. nadolol 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n9. sucralfate 1 gram Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO four times a\nday as needed for abdominal pain for 7 days.\nDisp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n10. tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6)\nhours as needed for pain for 1 weeks.\nDisp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n11.
