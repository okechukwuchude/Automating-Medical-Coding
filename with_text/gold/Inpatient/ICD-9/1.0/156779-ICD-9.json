She was discharged on IV\nganciclovir until 2 negative CMV VLs, and transitioned to oral\nvalganciclovir secondary ppx to continue for 3 mos from her\nadmission. How this was discontinued is unclear: possibly on\n[**10-10**] due to neutropenia, and outside records note negative CMV\nVL on [**10-18**]. She was also at [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center from\n[**Date range (1) 23929**] septic shock due to pseudomonas bacteremia,\ncompleting a course of ?zosyn on [**10-27**].\n\nOn [**10-27**] pt began having fevers. A CMV viral load was rechecked\n(970) and repeat VL of 4059 on [**11-2**]. It is unclear when\nganciclovir was restarted, but by [**11-2**], she was on ganciclovir\nwith HD dosing. She became hypotensive on [**11-6**] with mild\nabdominal pain, sent to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to MICU on\nnorepinephrine. She was treated with stress-dose steroids,\nempiric PO vancomycin, IV vancomycin, IV zosyn and IV\ngancyclovir. CT abd/pelvis showed uncomplicated sigmoid\ndiverticulitis. All other culture data and infectious workup\n(including c. diff toxin negative x 3) was unrevealing as to\nanother source of infection. She was started on midodrine for\npersistent hypotension to 70-80s systolic. Also was\nprogressively pancytopenic, though to be from pip-tazo. She was\ndischarged on PO cipro and flagyl for diverticulitis, 10 mg\ndaily prednisone, with her tacrolimus decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **]. Also\ndischarged on IV ganciclovir, planning to switch to oral after 2\nnegative VLs, although stopped at some point in rehab.\n\nWhile in rehab, BPs had remained normotensive. Yesterday am, she\nawoke nauseated and febrile, with a temp of 104.0. Blood\ncultures (2 sets) were sent from rehab. Also c/o LLQ pain. In\nthe ED, her Tmax was 102, with BP 142/82. CT abd showed\ndiverticulitis similar to prior. UA was positive. CXR improved\nfrom prior. Was given vanco/zosyn/flagyl and admitted.\n\nOn arrival to HD today, she was tachycardic to 130s, apparently\nsinus rhythm. HD was stopped after 1 hour due to progressive\ntachycardia to the 160s, with fever to 103.2, despite running\nher volume even. After stopping HD, she became hypotensive to\nSBP 60s, with preserved mental status. After 1L IVF, her BP\nimproved to 86/44 with HR 107. Temp improved to 100.3 after\nacetaminophen. Currently c/o nausea and fatigue, no resting abd\npain but 10/10 L sided abd pain with palpation. Also c/o fevers,\nno chills or sweats. Has some diarrhea that pt notes as chronic\nand unchanged. Makes small amt urine and confirms dysuria,\nfrequency, urgency. Denies vomiting, CP, SOB, cough, sputum,\nwheezing, HA, vision changes, confusion.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- ESRD due to SLE, s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**8-/2147**]\ncomplicated by FSGS and transplant failure [**7-/2149**], now on HD\n- SLE, followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rheumatology\n- Hypotension (started on midodrine [**11-5**])\n- Septic shock [**10/2149**]\n- CMV viremia [**10/2149**]\n- Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [**10/2149**]\n- hx of C.

No evidence of\nperforation or abscess formation.\n2. Mild enhancement of the transplanted kidney in the right\nlower quadrant, which is similar in appearance to the prior\nstudy. No evidence of perinephric fluid collection or abscess.\n3. Persistently dilated pancreatic duct may be related to\nampullary stenosis or IPMN. As noted previously, if not already\nperformed, consultation with the Pancreas Center may assist in\nevaluation.\n\nCXR [**2149-11-24**]:\nSince interval examination from [**2149-11-11**], there has been\nimprovement in left lower lobe atelectasis and removal of a\ncentral venous catheter. The lungs are clear with no signs of\npneumonia or congestive heart failure. No pleural effusions or\npneumothorax.

Cultures revealed negative blood cultures,\nurine culture positive for klebsiella 10-100,000 colonies and\npositive clostridium difficle.  She had a CT of the abdomen\nwhich revealed diverticulitis.  CXR did not show evidence of\npneumonia.  She was initially started on broad spectrum\nantibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime and this was\ntransitioned to PO vancomycin and tigacycline for coverage of\nclostridium difficle as well as IV Gancyclovir given her history\nof CMV viremia.  Her hypotension resolved with 1 liter of normal\nsaline.  She also received stress dose steroids given her\nhistory of long term steroid use.  She was transitioned to the\nfloor.  Cortisol stim test was performed which was negative.\nHer hypotension was responsive to fluid boluses.  She was\ncontinued on midodrine.  On the floor she was found to have a\npositive c diff toxin.  She was started on vancomycin taper with\nresolution of her abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Fevers abated.\nShe was covered with valgancyclovir for CMV prophylaxis and\natovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  Towards the end of her\nhospitalization, her fevers reappeared without accompanying\nhypotension.  Pan culture revealed no organism repeatedly.  Her\nleft arm at the fistula site was painful and ultrasound revealed\nextensive clot burden.  Transplant surgery did not feel\nimmediate correction was required; a tunneled line was placed\nfor HD.  PICC line was removed and cultures were negative.  Her\nfevers were felt secondary to clot burden.  She was discharged\non empiric vancomycin to be given with each HD treatment for a\ntotal of four weeks.  She was discharged on vancomycin taper for\nc difficile and prophylaxis as mentioned above in addition to\nthe vancomycin with dialysis.\n\nPancytopenia:  Patient has a history of pancytopenia of unclear\ncause.  Differential diagnosis considered includes drug reaction\nfrom zosyn, CMV viremia versus lupus related.  Her blood counts\nwere stable from recent admission and were trended.  CMV viral\nload was negative.\n\nRenal transplant: Complicated by graft FSGS and ESRD on HD.  She\nreceived stress dose steroids as above in the setting of sepsis.\n She was followed by the renal consult and transplant services.\nShe was continued on tacrolimus 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased from 2 mg\n[**Hospital1 **]) and atovaquone for prophylaxis. She received hemodialysis\ntreatments three times a week as per her home schedule. Given\nher clotted fistula towards the end of her hospitalization, a\ntunneled HD line was placed as mentioned above.  Transplant\nsurgery will see her in outpatient follow up for consideration\nof placement of new fistula on the right arm.  Her tacrolimus\nwas discontinued at time of discharge given that she does not\nrequire tacrolimus any longer secondary to graft failure.\n\nHyperglycemia: Attributed to corticosteroid therapy. She was\ntreated with a humalog sliding scale.\n\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation: In sinus rhythm on discharge 10\ndays ago and currently. Not on warfarin.  She was continued on\naspirin.\n.\nDispo - Discharged to rehab following resolution of abdominal\npain, diarrhea, fever work up, and tunneled line placement.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHOME MEDICATIONS: (from d/c summary dated [**2149-11-14**])\n- Atovaquone 1500mg (10ml) PO daily\n- Aspirin 325mg PO daily\n- Pantoprazole 40mg PO Q24hrs\n- B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1mg capsule PO daily\n- Midodrine 10mg PO TID\n- Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO Q24hrs - ended [**11-16**]\n- Flagyl 500mg PO Q8hrs - ended [**11-16**]\n- Tacrolimus 2mg PO Q12hrs\n- Ganciclovir 110mg IV QHD\n- Heparin 5000units SQ TID\n- Insulin glargine 2units SQ QHS\n- Insulin NPH 4units SQ QAM\n- Insulin Humalog sliding scale\n- Prednisone 10mg PO daily\n- Zofran 4mg IV Q8hrs PRN nausea\n- Epogen 15000units QHD\n- Bisacodyl 5-10mg PO daily PRN constipation\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Clostridium difficile colitis\n2. Fistula Repair\n3. Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nStable for discharge.  On room air, ambulating with assistance.\nResolved diarrhea and abdominal pain, intermittent continued low\ngrade fevers.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Ms [**Known lastname 6357**],\n\nIt was a pleasure caring for you while you were in the hospital.\nYou were first admitted to the hospital because of pain in your\nabdomen that was caused by Clostridium difficile.  Because of\nthis infection, you developed pain in your abdomen, fevers, and\nyour blood pressure was low.  During dialysis, your blood\npressure fell even further.  To treat you, we started you on\nantibiotics for the infection and your pain and fevers improved.\n You will need to continue to take these antibiotics for several\nmore weeks.  The course of antibiotics is described below.\n.\nDuring your hospital stay, your fistula on your left arm also\nstopped working.  Because you needed dialysis, we placed a new\nline (called a tunneled line) that will allow us to continue\ndialysis.  The transplant surgeons want to create a new fistula\nfor you to use, and you have a follow up appointment set up with\nthem as an outpatient to arrange this.  We also decided to\ncontinue you on antibiotics to be given during dialysis to treat\nthe possibility of infection in the area of the fistula.\n.\nThe medication changes we made during this hospitalization were:\n1. We started you on oral vancomycin.  You should continue to\ntake this with the following regimen:\n(a) take 125 mg daily by mouth for one week ([**2149-12-8**] - [**2149-12-14**])\n(b) then take 125 mg every other day for one week ([**2149-12-15**] -\n[**2149-12-21**])\n(c) then take 125 mg every third day for two weeks ([**2149-12-22**] -\n[**2150-1-4**])\n2.  You can take 5 mg of the prednisone every day instead of 10\nmg.\n3.  You will be receiving vancomycin intravenously with\nhemodialysis until [**2150-1-1**] to complete a 4 week course.\n4. You should take vangancyclovir 450 mg twice a week with\ndialysis.\n5. You can take oxycodone 5 mg as needed every 6 hours for pain.\n\n6. You should stop taking gancyclovir IV.\n7. You should stop taking tacrolimus.\n.\nPlease keep the follow up appointments scheduled for you below.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\n1) You have an appointment with a transplant infectious disease\ndoctor, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**], on [**12-23**] at 930 AM.  Please call\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you have any other questions.\n2) You have an appointment with your kidney doctor, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\n[**Name (STitle) **] on [**2149-12-18**] at 9:40 AM.   If you have any questions,\nhis phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].\n.\n3) You have an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from\ntransplant surgery at 1:40 PM on [**2149-12-25**].  If you\nhave any questions regarding this appointment, please call\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].\n\n\n                             [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 6735**]\n\n"

      "text": "TITLE:\n   Chief Complaint:  Hypotension\n   HPI:\n   This is a 52 yo female with ESRD on HD, s/p failed renal transplant,\n   who was discharged 1.5 wks ago for septic shock thought due to CMV\n   viremia and diverticulitis, who presented yesterday to [**Hospital1 1**] with a\n   fever to 104.\n   To summarize her recent history, she was admitted [**Date range (1) 10101**]/[**2148**] with\n   ARF leading to her graft failure, found to also have CMV viremia and C.\n   diff colitis. She was discharged on IV ganciclovir until 2 negative CMV\n   VLs, and transitioned to oral valganciclovir secondary ppx to continue\n   for 3 mos from her admission. How this was discontinued is unclear:\n   possibly on [**10-10**] due to neutropenia, and outside records note negative\n   CMV VL on [**10-18**]. She was also at [**Hospital **] Medical Center from [**Date range (1) 10102**]\n   septic shock due to pseudomonas bacteremia, completing a course of\n   ?zosyn on [**10-27**].\n   On [**10-27**] pt began having fevers. A CMV viral load was rechecked (970)\n   and repeat VL of 4059 on [**11-2**]. It is unclear when ganciclovir was\n   restarted, but by [**11-2**], she was on ganciclovir with HD dosing. She\n   became hypotensive on [**11-6**] with mild abdominal pain, sent to [**Hospital1 1**] and\n   admitted to MICU on norepinephrine. She was treated with stress-dose\n   steroids, empiric PO vancomycin, IV vancomycin, IV zosyn and IV\n   gancyclovir. CT abd/pelvis showed uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.\n   All other culture data and infectious workup (including c. diff toxin\n   negative x 3) was unrevealing as to another source of infection. She\n   was started on midodrine for persistent hypotension to 70-80s systolic.\n   Also was progressively pancytopenic, though to be from pip-tazo. She\n   was discharged on PO cipro and flagyl for diverticulitis, 10 mg daily\n   prednisone, with her tacrolimus decreased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **]. Also discharged\n   on IV ganciclovir, planning to switch to oral after 2 negative VLs,\n   although stopped at some point in rehab.\n   While in rehab, BPs had remained normotensive. Yesterday am, she awoke\n   nauseated and febrile, with a temp of 104.0. Blood cultures (2 sets)\n   were sent from rehab. Also c/o LLQ pain. In the ED, her Tmax was 102,\n   with BP 142/82. CT abd showed diverticulitis similar to prior. UA was\n   positive. CXR improved from prior. Was given vanco/zosyn/flagyl and\n   admitted.\n   On arrival to HD today, she was tachycardic to 130s, apparently sinus\n   rhythm. HD was stopped after 1 hour due to progressive tachycardia to\n   the 160s, with fever to 103.2, despite running her volume even. After\n   stopping HD, she became hypotensive to SBP 60s, with preserved mental\n   status. After 1L IVF, her BP improved to 86/44 with HR 107. Temp\n   improved to 100.3 after acetaminophen. Currently c/o nausea and\n   fatigue, no resting abd pain but 10/10 L sided abd pain with palpation.\n   Also c/o fevers, no chills or sweats. Has some diarrhea that pt notes\n   as chronic and unchanged. Makes small amt urine and confirms dysuria,\n   frequency, urgency. Denies vomiting, CP, SOB, cough, sputum, wheezing,\n   HA, vision changes, confusion.\n   Patient admitted from: [**Hospital1 1**] [**Hospital1 192**]\n   History obtained from [**Hospital 31**] Medical records\n   Allergies:\n   Bactrim Ds (Oral) (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim)\n   Exfoliative [**Doctor Last Name **]\n   Cellcept (Oral) (Mycophenolate Mofetil)\n   Rash;\n   Zosyn (Intraven) (Piperacillin Sodium/Tazobactam)\n   Myelosuppressio\n   Last dose of Antibiotics:\n   Infusions:\n   Other ICU medications:\n   Other medications:\n   HOME MEDICATIONS: (from d/c summary dated [**2149-11-14**])\n   - Atovaquone 1500mg (10ml) PO daily\n   - Aspirin 325mg PO daily\n   - Pantoprazole 40mg PO Q24hrs\n   - B Complex-Vitamin C-Folic Acid 1mg capsule PO daily\n   - Midodrine 10mg PO TID\n   - Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO Q24hrs - ended [**11-16**]\n   - Flagyl 500mg PO Q8hrs - ended [**11-16**]\n   - Tacrolimus 2mg PO Q12hrs\n   - Ganciclovir 110mg IV QHD\n   - Heparin 5000units SQ TID\n   - Insulin glargine 2units SQ QHS\n   - Insulin NPH 4units SQ QAM\n   - Insulin Humalog sliding scale\n   - Prednisone 10mg PO daily\n   - Zofran 4mg IV Q8hrs PRN nausea\n   - Epogen 15000units QHD\n   - Bisacodyl 5-10mg PO daily PRN constipation\n   TRANSFER MEDS:\n   Notable for PO vanc (not yet received), IV ganciclovir (not yet\n   received), IV vanc, IV cefepime.\n   Past medical history:\n   Family history:\n   Social History:\n   - ESRD due to SLE, s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**8-/2147**] complicated\n   by FSGS and transplant failure [**7-/2149**], now on HD\n   - SLE, followed by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 8105**] in Rheumatology\n   - Hypotension (started on midodrine [**11-5**])\n   - Septic shock [**10/2149**]\n   - CMV viremia [**10/2149**]\n   - Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [**10/2149**]\n   - hx of C.
