      "text": "Chief Complaint:  Hypotension, fevers\n   HPI:\n   This is a 26 year old female with a history of severe scoliosis s/p\n   recent T3-T4 spinal fusion with thoracotomy (staged procedures on [**10-29**]\n   and [**11-1**]).  Her post-operative course was complicated by development\n   of pneumonia and severe pain.  She was discharge on [**11-12**] with plans\n   for a two week course of levofloxacin.  Since discharge she followed up\n   with her orthopedic surgeon on [**2136-11-16**] and was told that her wound was\n   feeling well.  On the day prior to presentation she developed fevers,\n   myalgias and diffuse left flank and back pain as well as body aches and\n   a dull frontal headache. She denies photophobia or neck stiffness. She\n   has a cough which is worsening but non-productive.  She has left sided\n   pleuritic chest pain which is slightly worsened over the past two\n   days.  She denies sore throat or rhinorrhea.  She has had mild gassy\n   abdominal pain and [**3-14**] stools per day but has been taking laxatives.\n   No nausea, vomiting or constipation.  No dysuria or hematuria.  No\n   rashes.  No indwelling lines.  No sick contacts.\n   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 102 P: 120 BP: 99/54 R: 20 O2 sat 97% on\n   RA. Labs were notable for a WBC count of 4.3 with 62% neutrophils.  She\n   had a CT Torso which showed a left sided infiltrate and some possible\n   gallbladder wall edema.  She subsequently had a RUQ ultrasound which\n   showed a mildly distended gallbladder but no edema.  LFTs were\n   negative.  She received 3 liters of normal saline, vanocycin 1 gram IV\n   x 1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1 and dilaudid 1 mg IV x 2.  She was seen by\n   orthopedics who felt that her incisions appeared to be healing well.\n   She was admitted to the floor for further management.\n   On arrival to the floor her blood pressure was 82/56.  She received an\n   additional 2 liters of normal saline without improvement.  Blood\n   cultures were drawn and she received tamiflu.

Currently\n   making good urine, mentating well and with normal lactate which argues\n   against end-organ malperfusion.  Souce is unclear.  Highest on the\n   differential would be blood stream versus hardware infection of the\n   back.  She also has a left sided infiltrate on chest CT which is being\n   treated with levofloxacin but has persistent cough and pleuritic chest\n   pain.  Given myalgias and high fevers, influenza is on the\n   differential.  Urinalysis is negative.  She has complained of diarrhea\n   so clostridium difficle should also be considered.  She received\n   vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric coverage of\n   sepsis of unclear etiology. Heart rate now in the 90s with blood\n   pressures in the high 90s systolic after 5 liters of IVF.  Unclear\n   baseline blood pressures, per nursing staff during her previous\n   hospitalization her baseline blood pressures were in the 90s but in\n   clinic it appears to be in the high 90s to 110s.\n   - normal saline boluses for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90\n   - will need to consider central IV access if persistent hypotension\n   - close monitoring of urine output\n   - will follow blood cultures\n   - will send sputum, c. diff and influenza swab\n   - vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis\n   - continue tamiflu pending influenza swab\n   - f/u ESR and CRP which were sent from floor\n   - monitor fever curve and WBC count\n   - will need to consider additional imaging to assess for evidence of\n   surgical infectious complications\n   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low\n   risk for hardware infection.\n   - will follow orthopedics recommendations for consideration of\n   additional imaging\n   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent\n   hospitalization.

Now the most likely source is her lungs, and a\n   possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.  [**11-19**] CXR\n   showed left-sided pleural effusion combined to left lower lobe area of\n   consolidation with air bronchograms (new), which is consistent with\n   PNA.  She received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for\n   empiric coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology. Blood cultures are\n   negative to date. ID was consulted and felt that CXR improved from\n   prior hospitalization when patient was aggressively treated for PNA, so\n   we do not need to treat that at this point. Recommended oseltamavir\n   (H1N1), ramantadine (for coverage of possible seasonal flu in addition\n   to H1N1).  Currently afebrile\n   - f/u blood and sputum (has not yet produced enough sputum for sputum\n   culture)\n   - d/c vanc &zosyn\n   - continue tamiflu x5 day course\n   - Rimantadine 100mg PO BID x5 day course\n   - monitor fever curve and WBC count\n   Hypotension: Baseline from last hospitalization 90s-100s/60s. [**Last Name (un) **] stim\n   test result equivocal. ECHO shows normal function of heart, so not\n   concern for CHF due to flu. Will follow up on endocrine results. Also\n   concern for if this is a valid result. Will check with smaller BP cuff\n   and manual cuff. If continues low will insert arterial line for more\n   accurate measurement.\n   - Endocrine consult\n   -Manual measurement\n   -Arterial line if continuing low\n   Leukopenia: Patient WBC count on arrival 4.3, trending down. Today\n   slightly increased from 2.8 yesterday to 3.3 today. ID feels likely\n   secondary to marrow suppression from viral illness vs. beta lactam\n   exposure.\n   -D/c vanco & Zosyn\n   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low\n   risk for hardware infection; did not feel imaging was necassary\n   Vaginal Itching: Patient appears to have yeast infection. Will send\n   sample of discharge and give 150mg of fluconazole x1. Patient states\n   improved now after 1 dose of fluconazole.\n   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent\n   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine. Patient reports that\n   pain regimen yesterday worked well for her\n   - Consult pain service as this worked well for her on her prior\n   admission.\n   - PO dilaudid for breakthrough\n   - Pain service will come by today, talk about plan for weaning\n   FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet\n   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen  with Dulcolax\n   Access: Peripherals, may need to consider central access if persistent\n   hypotension\n   Code: Full code\n   Communication: Patient and Mom [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11336**]\n   [**Name2 (NI) **]osition: Pending clinical improvement\n if pressures stable to\n   floor late today or tomorrow.\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   22 Gauge - [**2136-11-19**] 02:00 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition:\n"

Her post-operative course was\ncomplicated by development of pneumonia and severe pain.  She\nwas discharge on [**11-12**] with plans for a two week course of\nlevofloxacin.  Since discharge she followed up with her\northopedic surgeon on [**2136-11-16**] and was told that her wound was\nhealing well.  On the day prior to presentation she developed\nfevers, myalgias and diffuse left flank and back pain as well as\nbody aches and a dull frontal headache. She denies photophobia\nor neck stiffness. She has a cough which is worsening but\nnon-productive.  She has left sided pleuritic chest pain which\nis slightly worsened over the past two days.  She denies sore\nthroat or rhinorrhea.  She has had mild gassy abdominal pain and\n[**3-14**] stools per day but has been taking laxatives.  No nausea,\nvomiting or constipation.  No dysuria or hematuria.  No rashes.\nNo indwelling lines.  Her mother and daughter have both been\nsick with upper respiratory symptoms.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: T: 102 P: 120 BP: 99/54 R: 20 O2 sat\n97% on RA. Labs were notable for a WBC count of 4.3 with 62%\nneutrophils.  She had a CT Torso which showed a left sided\ninfiltrate and some possible gallbladder wall edema.  She\nsubsequently had a RUQ ultrasound which showed a mildly\ndistended gallbladder but no edema.  LFTs were negative.  She\nreceived 3 liters of normal saline, vanocycin 1 gram IV x 1,\nzosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1 and dilaudid 1 mg IV x 2.  She was seen by\northopedics who felt that her incisions appeared to be healing\nwell.  She was admitted to the floor for further management.\n.\nOn arrival to the floor her blood pressure was 82/56.  She\nreceived an additional 2 liters of normal saline without\nimprovement.  Blood cultures were drawn and she received\ntamiflu.  The decision was made to transfer the patient to the\nMICU.\n\nPast Medical History:\nMigraine\ns/p spinal fusion\nScoliosis\n\nSocial History:\nMoved back in with Mom prior to procedure.

A brief description of her\nhospital course according to problem is described below:\n.\nFever/Myalgias:  When the patient originally presented there was\nconcern that the constellation of fevers, tachycardia and\nhypotension represented sepsis. She persistently had a good\nurine output, mentated well and had a normal lactate. She\nreceived vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric\ncoverage of sepsis of unclear etiology and was initially\nadmitted to the ICU.  She was found to be influenza A positive.\nShe was started on oseltamivir and rimantidine. Her other\nantibiotics were stopped after 48 hours.  Ortho was consulted\nand did not believe there was an infection in her hardware and\ndid not recommend surgery. She was continued on oseltamivir for\n5 days. She had one dose of rimantadine remaining when she was\ndischarged. On the day of discharge she had one set of blood\ncultures from admission that were still negative, but not\nfinalized.\n.\nHypotension: During her previous hospitalization her baseline\nblood pressures were in the 90s. In clinic records it was in the\nhigh 90s to 110s. On admission she was given normal saline fluid\nboluses to help maintain adequate systolic blood pressure.\nAlthough she appeared clinically well, she continued to have\nblood pressures in the low 90's and high 80's. She was kept in\nthe unit for monitoring. An endocrine and cardiac assessment\nwere done to discover any potential underlying causes. She had\nan echocardiogram which showed an EF of >55%. There was normal\nglobal and regional biventricular systolic function. No\npulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular\ndisease was seen. An endocrine workup included measurements of\nACTH and cortisol. She was transferred to the floor and\nmaintained a systolic blood pressure in the mid 90's. Her\nhypotension was thought to be related to the severe illness.\n.\nPain:  The pain service was consulted. Her gabapentin was\nincreased to three times daily. Her hydromorphone was also\nincreased. She received MS Contin three times daily.\n.\nVaginal Yeast Infection: She was treated for a vaginal yeast\ninfection in the unit with fluconazole.\n.\nPost-op: Ortho was consulted.
