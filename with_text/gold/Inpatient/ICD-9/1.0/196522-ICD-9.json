He is unclear on the specifics of why he had the procedure,\nbut does not believe that he underwent PCI.Over the past six\nmonths he has been bothered by chest discomfort, dyspnea and\nfatigue. This can occur with walking about one block. In\naddition, he notices right calf\npain with similar amounts of walking.Denies edema, orthopnea,\nPND, lightheadedness. Cardiac workup with his PCP showed an\nabnormal ETT and he was referred for an elective cardiac\ncatheterization [**2150-3-26**], which revealed three  vessel coronary\ndisease.

The\nleft ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex\n(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in\nthe descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nPost Bypass: Patient is A paced, on phenylepherine infusion.\nPreserved biventricular function. LVEF 55%. MR is now trace.\nAortic contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All\nfindings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nInterpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting\nphysician\n\nCardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2150-4-3**]  2:08:28 PM\n\n\nSinus rhythm.

See operative report\nfor further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative\nantibiotics.  Post operatively he was transferred to the\nintensive care unit for management.  In the first twenty four\nhours he was weaned from sedation, awoke, and was extubated\nwithout complications.  He continued to do well and was\ntransferred to the floor.  His percocet was stopped due to\nconfusion which resolved.  Physical therapy worked with him on\nstrength and mobility.  He was ready for discharge home with\nservices on post operative day four.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nATORVASTATIN [LIPITOR] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 10 mg\nTablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every morning\nDILTIAZEM HCL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 300 mg\nCapsule,\nSustained Release - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth every morning\nINSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) -\n100\nunit/mL Solution - 34 units at bedtime\nINSULIN LISPRO [HUMALOG] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 100\nunit/mL Solution - 14 units before breakfast, 8 units before\nlunch, 14 units before dinner\nISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 60 mg\nTablet Sustained Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every\nmorning\nMETFORMIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 850 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth twice a day\nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 25 mg\nTablet Sustained Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth qam\nQUINAPRIL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth every morning\nASPIRIN -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 325 mg Tablet,\nDelayed Release (E.C.) - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every morning\nOLMESARTAN-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE [BENICAR HCT] -  (Prescribed by\nOther Provider; OTC) - 20 mg-12.5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by\nmouth daily every morning\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
