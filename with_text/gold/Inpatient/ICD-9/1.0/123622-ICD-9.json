He was found to be newly hyponatremic to\na Na of 117 in the ED and therefore admitted to the MICU.\n.\nHe was discharged last Wednesday (5 days prior to admission), he\nwas discharged to home after being diagnosed with a pneumonia.\nDuring his admission, he had worsening renal failure and\nevaluated with a renal ultrasound that did not show hydro. His\nrespiratory status returned to baseline.  He was discharged home\non augmentin.  His Na had already started to drift downward\nduring the admission and was 129 on discharge.  He also had mild\ndiarrhea during his admission.\n.\nAfter going home, he was mostly in bed due to profound weakness.\n His family was watching his legs and noted the little bit of\nswelling and new blue color.  They called his PCP today who\nsuggested ED evaluation.  He otherwise has no complaints.  He\nhas generalized weakness and intermittent periods of shortness\nof breath.  Per the daughter, he has been not eating, but trying\nto drink a lot.  He is afraid to sleep because he is scared of\ndeath.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vitals were T 97.8, P 80, BP 147/74, R 24 and\n99% on 3L (his home O2 level).  He remained stable with some\nhypertension to SBPs in the 170s.  He had a CXR that showed mild\nfluid overlad.  He had a CT abd that showed no aortic aneurysm\nleak.  Vascular was consulted and worried that his foot\ndiscoloration was related to embolic events and heparin was\nstarted with a bolus.  The patient was guiac negative in the ED.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- COPD\n- CAD\n- HTN\n- AAA s/p repair\n- CRF (recent baseline ~2.7, ?atheroembolic)\n- BPH\n\nSocial History:\n- Quit smoking 30y ago (~50 pack years)\n- Lives with his wife who has [**Name (NI) 2481**] dementia; caregiving\nhas become increasingly stressful.\n\n\nFamily History:\nnon-contributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral Appearance: Thin, Anxious\n.\nEyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL, Pupils dilated\n.\nCardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal), (Murmur: Systolic),\nsoft systolic murmur\n.\nPeripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial\npulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse:\nPresent)\n.\nRespiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds:\nCrackles : at bases, Diminished: at bilateral bases)\n.\nAbdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present\n.\nExtremities: pads of toes and plantar surface of foot is\npurplish, but warm, with petechiaie on the dorsum of the feet\n.\nMusculoskeletal: Muscle wasting\n.\nSkin:  Cool\n.\nNeurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Not\nassessed, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed\n\n\nPertinent Results:\nOn admission:\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   PLT COUNT-173\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   NEUTS-67.0 LYMPHS-23.1 MONOS-8.1 EOS-1.3\nBASOS-0.6\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   WBC-5.2 RBC-4.20* HGB-12.0* HCT-37.5* MCV-89\nMCH-28.6 MCHC-32.0 RDW-15.6*\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   OSMOLAL-260*\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   CALCIUM-10.3 PHOSPHATE-3.9 MAGNESIUM-1.9\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   proBNP-GREATER TH\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   cTropnT-0.09*\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   estGFR-Using this\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:09PM   GLUCOSE-110* UREA N-36* CREAT-2.5*\nSODIUM-117* POTASSIUM-5.4* CHLORIDE-84* TOTAL CO2-22 ANION\nGAP-16\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:32PM   HGB-12.9* calcHCT-39\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:32PM   LACTATE-1.9 NA+-119* K+-5.2\n[**2110-8-11**] 04:32PM   COMMENTS-GREEN TOP\n\nDuring hospitalization/On discharge:\n[**2110-8-18**] 07:05AM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-3.79* Hgb-11.5* Hct-34.2*\nMCV-90 MCH-30.4 MCHC-33.7 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-54*\n[**2110-8-20**] 06:50AM BLOOD WBC-6.4 RBC-4.05* Hgb-12.3* Hct-36.0*\nMCV-89 MCH-30.4 MCHC-34.2 RDW-15.4 Plt Ct-80*\n[**2110-8-20**] 06:50AM BLOOD Glucose-102* UreaN-46* Creat-2.6* Na-134\nK-4.1 Cl-92* HCO3-27 AnGap-19\n[**2110-8-14**] 05:30AM BLOOD ALT-768* AST-348* AlkPhos-91 TotBili-0.7\n[**2110-8-20**] 06:50AM BLOOD ALT-132* AST-45* CK(CPK)-PND AlkPhos-61\nTotBili-0.7\n[**2110-8-20**] 06:50AM BLOOD Albumin-3.5 Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.1\n[**2110-8-21**] 07:05AM BLOOD ALT-19 AST-33\n[**2110-8-16**] 12:00PM BLOOD HEPARIN DEPENDENT ANTIBODIES- Optical\ndensity 0.692\n.\n\n[**2110-8-22**] 07:35AM BLOOD PT-55.2* PTT-85.7* INR(PT)-6.2*\n[**2110-8-22**] 07:35AM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-3.76* Hgb-11.4* Hct-33.7*\nMCV-90 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.7 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-118*\n[**2110-8-22**] 07:35AM BLOOD Glucose-104* UreaN-40* Creat-2.3* Na-135\nK-4.0 Cl-96 HCO3-28 AnGap-15\n[**2110-8-22**] 07:35AM BLOOD Calcium-9.1 Phos-2.6* Mg-2.1\n.\nStudies:\n[**2110-8-12**]:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately\ndepressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis with hypokinesis\nelsewhere (LVEF= 35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear\nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nMild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is\nmild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2104-10-2**], left ventricular function is now\ndepressed.\n.\n[**2110-8-17**] CXR read:\nPortable chest radiograph is compared to multiple prior\nexaminations. Since the prior study, there is mild improvement\nin the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural effusion\nand atelectasis. Left lung is relatively clear.\nCardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no\ncongestive failure.\n.\n[**2110-8-12**] echo:\nINTERPRETATION: This 81 y/o man with a h/o CAD, CHF, COPD and\nrenal\nfailure s/p AAA repair was referred for evaluation of chest\npain. The\npatient was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4\nminutes. No\nchest, neck, back or arm discomfort was reported by the patient\nthroughout the procedure. The EKG is uninterpretable for\nischemia in the\npresence of a LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APDs\nand\nVPDs. Hemodynamic response to infusion was appropriate.\nPost-infusion\nduring the IV injection of 125mg of Aminophylline, the patient\nreported\ndizziness with a palp blood pressure of 88/-mmHg. Patient was\nimmediately placed in the Trendelenburg position with a BP of\n106/palp\nand relief of dizziness.\nIMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with uninterpretable EKG\nchanges.\nNuclear report sent separately.\n.\nCARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE [**2110-8-19**]:\nINTERPRETATION:\nThe image quality is adequate but limited due to activity\nadjacent to the\nheart.\nLeft ventricular cavity size is normal.\nRest and stress perfusion images reveal a fixed, moderate\nreduction in photon counts involving the mid and basal inferior\nand inferolateral walls.\nGated images reveal hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferior\nand inferolateral walls. There is septal akinesis with normal\nthickening, consistent with LBBB.\nThe remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.\nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 30% with an\nEDV of 78 ml.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Fixed, medium-sized, moderate severity perfusion defect\ninvolving the PDA territory.\n2. Normal left ventricular cavity size. Severe systolic\ndysfunction with\nhypokinesis of the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral\nwalls. The\nremaining segments are mildly hypokinetic.\nCompared with the study of [**2104-10-6**], myocardial perfusion\nappears similar.\nLeft ventricular systolic dysfunction has deteriorated.\n.\nSTRESS TEST:\nINTERPRETATION: This 81 y/o man with a h/o CAD, CHF, COPD and\nrenal\nfailure s/p AAA repair was referred for evaluation of chest\npain. The\npatient was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4\nminutes. No\nchest, neck, back or arm discomfort was reported by the patient\nthroughout the procedure. The EKG is uninterpretable for\nischemia in the\npresence of a LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated APDs\nand\nVPDs. Hemodynamic response to infusion was appropriate.\nPost-infusion\nduring the IV injection of 125mg of Aminophylline, the patient\nreported\ndizziness with a palp blood pressure of 88/-mmHg. Patient was\nimmediately placed in the Trendelenburg position with a BP of\n106/palp\nand relief of dizziness.\nIMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with uninterpretable EKG\nchanges.\nNuclear report sent separately.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n81 y/o M with hx of COPD, CAD, AAA, and BPH presents today after\na recent admission for pneumonia with new swelling and\ndiscoloration of his bilateral feet.  The patient was also found\nto be severely hyponatremic.\n.\n# HIT: Pt's platelets dropped from admission levels of 173,000\n([**2110-8-11**]) to 54,000 ([**2110-8-18**]).  Suspicion for HIT was high and\nHeparin PF4 antibody was sent and was positive with an optical\ndensity of 0.692.  Anything greater than 0.4 is considered a\npositive result, however, strong positivity occurs when the\noptical density is larger than 1.  In consideration with the\npatient's clinical history a high clinical suspicion for HIT and\nthe positive test results, Heme felt comfortable with this\ndiagnosis. Pt stopped all heparin products, was started on\nargatroban  0.5 mcg/kg/min IV DRIP on [**2110-8-18**] and then began\nbeing bridge to warfarin  with a starting dose of 3mg daily on\n[**2110-8-19**].  Last INR before discharge was 6.3 with a goal INR of\n[**5-13**] for combined therapy. The pt must be overlapped for a 5 days\nbridge with INRS [**5-13**] on argatroban and coumadin (argatroban\nelevated your INR which is why the INR goal must be so high\nwhile overlapped). We are decreasing his warfarin dose to 2.5 mg\ndaily on [**2110-8-22**].  After the 5 day bridge is complete the pt's\nINR goal is [**3-12**]. He will follow up with hematology as an\noutpatient. PLTS must be 150 prior to stopping argatroban.\n.\n# Hyponatremia:  The patient was found to be hyponatremic upon\nadmission. At that point the patient's volume status was unclear\nas he had signs of hyper- and hypovolemia. The patient was\nintravascularly volume depleted at the level of the kidney: his\nFENa was 0.14% (<1), and the urine lytes demonstrated a very\nelevated osm, very low Na, high spec [**Last Name (un) **]. The patient was also\nthought to be in heart failure given risk factors of CAD and\nCKD, bilateral lower leg edema, elevated BNP to >70,000,\ncrackles on physical exam, and pleural effusions. Yet, the\npatient's urine electrolytes suggested hypovolemia, especially\nin the setting of recent decreased PO intake, diarrhea, flat\nJVP, and dry MM. The patient's cachexia and recent failure to\nthrive since his last hospital admission were consistent with\nboth a hypo or hyper volemic state. The patient was given a\nsmall normal saline bolus overnight observe whether his sodium\nimproved. As neither his sodium or respiratory status changed,\nhyponatremia secondary to heart failure became more probable as\nhyponatremia and resp status worsened. The patient was given\n20mg of IV lasix in the morning and afternoon of [**8-12**] with good\nurine output. Afternoon electrolytes revealed a modest increase\nin Na from 117 to 119. On [**8-13**], pt was given a total of 80 mg IV\nLasix that day with a TBB of -1.9L. His Na that day increased to\n125. He was put on standing Lasix 20 mg IV TID on [**8-14**] before\nbeing called out to the floor, at which point his Na had further\nincreased to 127. Na continued to slowly climb as pt was\ndiuresed on the floor over the next few days. No symptoms [**3-11**] to\nhyponatermia were ever witnessed during admission. On date of\ndischarge pt [**Name (NI) **] was 135.  Patient had symptomatic ORTHOSTATIC\nHYPOTENSION WITH SYMPTOMS on the night of [**2110-8-20**] and persisted\nup until date of discharge.  Lasix were held since the first\nepisode but will need to be restarted when pt no longer\northostatic at a dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **].\n.\n# Bilateral Feet Discoloration/Edema: The patient's pedal\ndiscoloration was of unclear initial etiology; the main concern\nwas for atheroemboli given significant aortic calcification on\nCT and CKD likely [**3-11**] atheroembolic insults. Due to a concern\nfor microemboli from the patient's underlying AAA, a abd CT scan\nwas done in the emergency department and showed stable AAA\nwithout leakage. His ekg showed LBBB and 1st degree AVB,\nunchanged from the previous admission. Vascular [**Doctor First Name **] was\nconsulted and recommended a heparin drip, with a rate adjusted\nfor PTT, and a CT chest to assess for aortic arch thrombus,\nwhich was negative. The Heparin drip was d'ced on [**8-15**] per\nvascular surgery when they decided that foot was improved. pt\nwas placed on sub q heparin. Feet appearance were closely\nmonitored on the floor by the medicine teams since they had\nimproved while on heparin, even though the improvement was\nattributed to proper treatment of the new onset systolic heart\nfailure.\n.\n# Decompensated heart failure: The patient had clinical signs of\nheart failure on admission although the patient's last echo in\n[**2104**] was normal. Repeat echo on [**8-12**] revealed an EF of 35% and\nhypokinesis that had not previously been present. Cardiac\nenzymes were negative and pt did not have EKG changes consistent\nwith ACS. The patient was started on Lasix diuresis with good\nurine output, a daily TBB goal of at least -1L, and slow\nrestoration of his serum sodium. Heart failure meds were held\nuntil pt reaches dry weight. Patient was continued on ASA and\nrestarted on home atenolol on [**8-12**]. Statin was also started. Pt\nwas found to have large bilateral pulmonary effusions on CXR and\nchest CT which correlated with physical exam findings. These\nwere deemed [**3-11**] to his decomponsated heart failure. Despite what\nhad been initially reported, it was later learned that the\npatient was not chronically on home oxygen, but had merely been\non it for the last week after discharge from another hospital\nafter being treated with a PNA. As a result, the goal for the\npatient's heart failure treatment was to get his respiratory\nstatus to the point where he no longer needed supplemental O2.\nLASIX WAS HELD THE 2 DAYS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE DUE TO ORTHOSTASIS\nAS ABOVE but he will require lasix when no longer orthostatic\nand titrate up to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].  Pt had repear Persantine MIBI to\nevaluate patency of the coronary vessels.  Result from the\nstress test showed Fixed, medium-sized, moderate severity\nperfusion defect involving the PDA territory, which is similar\nto [**2104**] findings.  Also severe changes in systolic function was\nseen, which correlates with ECHO findings and presentation of\nsymptoms. HIS BETA-BLOCKER WAS HELD DUE TO ORTHOSTASIS BUT\nSHOULD BE RESTARTED at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].\n.\n# Insomnia/Anxiety: The patient had not been sleeping at home\nbecause, according to his daughter, he was scared of dying in\nhis sleep since his latest discharge from the hospital. The\npatient was written for trazodone 25 mg prn. Social Work was\ninvolved in organizing day-care for his progressively demented\nwife as pt was unable to continue to be her sole care-giver and\nhas had significant stress with this in the past few months,\naccording to his daughters. Sleeping in the hospital helped him\nfeel much better.\n.\n# COPD: Moderate-severe emphysema on chest CT. Stable, patient\nnow on his home O2 requirement of 3L; remote smoking history is\nlikely cause of his COPD. The patient was put on nebulizer\ntreatment as needed. On [**8-13**] he started coughing more, probably\ndue to increased mobilization of secretions with his increasing\nstrength and fluid shifts. Started chest PT on [**8-14**]. Despite what\nhad been initially reported, it was later learned that the\npatient was not chronically on home oxygen, but had merely been\non it for the last week after discharge from another hospital\nafter being treated with a PNA.\n.\n# H/o diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea was likely secondary to\nrecent antibiotic therapy. The diarrhea was not concerning for c\ndiff as the patient did not have a leukocytosis. No diarrhea in\nhouse.\n.\n# H/o pneumonia: The patient was recently treated during last\nadmission for pneumonia. The patient was currently stable on his\nhome O2 (started after the recent discharge) and cxr on\nadmission was without obvious infiltrate. Antibiotics were not\nintiated.

You\ncame here with a very low sodium level which is now normal, but\nwe also notice that you had a lot of extra fluid in your body.\nWe did some tests and they showed that your heart is not working\nas well as it used to.  You are in heart failure, but are now\ndoing much better than when you came into the hospital.  You\nwere given lasix to help get the extra fluid off your lungs and\nyou no longer require oxygen. We had to stop the lasix 2 days\nago because you were orthostatic (dropping your blood pressure\nwhen you sat up and stood up). YOu are still orthostatic and we\nare encouraging you to drink fluids. We cannot give you IV\nfluids due to your heart failure (not pumping blood out of the\nheart effectively).  You will need to restart lasix at some\npoint at rehab once you are no longer orthostatic.  Also we\nstarted you on a new blood pressure medication which is good for\nyour heart called metoprolol. We had to stop the metoprolol\nbecause you are orthostatic but this will be restarted at some\npoint at rehab.  We have made a follow up appointment with a\nheart failure doctor for you.\n\nIn addition, like most patients that come into the hospital, we\ngave you heparin to lower the risk of you getting blood clots.\nYou reacted to this heparin in a way that you platelets became\nvery low.  This reaction is not common.  We stopped the heparin,\nand started you on argatroban another medication to help prevent\nclots.  As your platelet numbers began to rise, we began to\nconvert you over to warfarin which is an anticlotting medication\nyou can take by mouth. You will need to take this for a while\nand will be advised when to stop by your new outpatient\nhematologist doctor.\n\nWhen we send you to the extended care facility we will continue\nyou on some of your old medications and also add some new ones.\nHere is a list below of all your medications, Old and New:\n\nMeds that will be continued:\nMVI 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]\nSimvastatin 20mg Daily\nRanitidine 150mg Daily\nOmega-3 Fatty Acid cap [**Hospital1 **] (If pt can swallow it)\nOs-Cal 500+D tabs [**Hospital1 **]\nnitroglycerin 0.3 sl daily prn chest pain you must call your\ndoctor if you use this\n\nMedications that are new:\nArgatroban 0.5 mcg/kg/min IV DRIP INFUSION (until properly\nswitched to warfarin)\nGuaifenesin [**6-16**] mL PO/NG Q6H:PRN\nWarfarin 2.5 mg PO/NG DAILY\nNasal Spray for dry nose\nAspirin 325mg Daily\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: VASCULAR SURGERY\nWhen: FRIDAY [**2110-8-29**] at 11:00 AM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1244**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SERVICES\nWhen: MONDAY [**2110-9-8**] at 3:00 PM\nWith: DR.
