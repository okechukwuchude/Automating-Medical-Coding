Right lower lobe is presumably\ncollapsed. Left lung grossly clear.  No left pleural effusion.\nNo pneumothorax. No free subdiaphragmatic gas.\n\nCXR: [**2115-12-25**]:\nSINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: An endotracheal tube tip terminates\n5 cm from\nthe carina. A left PICC terminates within the cavoatrial\njunction. An NG\ntube is partially imaged. Diffuse hazy opacification of the\nright hemithorax is compatible with a large layering right\npleural effusion, which is slightly denser compared to prior\nstudy, suggestive of an interval increase in size compared to\nthe prior study. Aside from left retrocardiac atelectasis, the\nleft lung is clear.\n\nIMPRESSION: Large right layering pleural effusion, slightly\nlarger compared to the prior study.\n\nCT HEAD [**2115-12-28**]:\nFINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,\nedema, or shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white\nmatter differentiation is preserved. Ventricles and sulci are\nprominent for age. Suprasellar and basilar cisterns appear\npatent. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well\naerated, within limitation of motion. Vascular calcification is\npresent in the cavernous carotid arteries. A scleral band is\nseen around the right globe. Soft tissues are within normal\nlimits.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass\neffect.\n\nNOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:\non the prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] dated [**2115-12-23**], there were FLAIR\nhyperintense foci in the left temporal lobe invovling the cortex\nand adjacent white amtter . These are possibly seen on the\npresent CT study as hypodense areas and are\ninadequately assessed. Consider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] if clinically indicated\nto assess the extent and anture (infarct vs encephalitis).\nProminent ventricles and sulci related to volume loss.\n\n[**2115-12-27**]: RUQ US:\nFINDINGS: The liver echotexture is slightly coarsened. In\nsegment V of the\nliver, there is a heterogeneous and overall hypoechoic lesion\nmeasuring 1.9 x 1.8 cm. This lesion was seen on the prior CT\nfrom [**2115-12-24**] and is\nconcerning for hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional hypoechoic\nareas are seen at the dome of the liver in a subdiaphragmatic\ndistribution and are likely artifact. The portal vein is patent\nand shows normal hepatopetal flow. There is no evidence of\nintra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile\nduct is normal in caliber, measuring 2 mm. The gallbladder wall\nis diffusely thickened, likely secondary to the patient's\nunderlying liver disease. The remainder of the gallbladder is\nnormal in appearance and no gallstones are identified.\n\nThe pancreatic tail is not well visualized secondary to\noverlying bowel gas.  The visualized portions of the pancreas\nare unremarkable. A small amount of perihepatic ascites is\npresent. A large right pleural effusion is seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Segment V liver lesion as previously seen on the CT from\n[**2115-12-24**] that is concerning for HCC.\n2. Additional hypoechoic foci in a subdiaphragmatic distribution\nalong the\ndome of the liver felt likely artifactual, but suggest attention\nto these\nregions on next contrast-enhanced scan.\n3. Large right pleural effusion.\n4. Small amount of perihepatic ascites.\n\n[**2115-12-23**] MR HEAD:\nFINDINGS:\nThere is an area of increased FLAIR/T2 signal within the left\ntemporal white matter and also involving the adjacent cortex (\nse 4, im [**9-11**], 13), with no associated enhancement or mass\neffect or decreased diffusion. Thsi may relate to encephalitis,\ninflammatory, infectious etiology/demeylinating\ndisease/associated with seizure. Small scattered FLAIR\nhyperintense foci int hecerebral white matter are liekly\nnon-specific.\n\nThere is symmetric prominence of the ventricles, cisterns and\nsulci. There is no other evidence of mass, infarct or\nhemorrhage. There is no pathologic intracranial enhancement.\nMajor intracranial flow voids are preserved.\n\nThe examination is otherwise significant for small amount of\nfluid/mucosal\nthickening in the mastoid tips, fluid layering in the pharynx,\nminimal\nmaxillary sinus mucosal thickening and abnormal shape of the\nright globe\nlikely status post scleral banding.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Area of increased FLAIR/T2 signal within the left temporal\nwhite matter\nand adjacent cortex could represent an area of evolving\nencephalitis,\ninflammatory, infectious or demyelinating process or related to\nseizure.\nCorrelation with CSF for Herpes, etc and continued follow up can\nbe\nconsidered.\n\n2. Symmetric prominence of the ventricles, cisterns and sulci\nfor age,\ncompatible with volume loss\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: This is a 49 yo male with PMH of HCV cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS\n(CD4 count 262 [**2115-12-16**]) who presented with hypoxic respiratory\nfailure was admitted to the MICU with a course that was\ncomplicated by persistent fevers, difficulty extubating and\nrapidly re-accumulating pleural effusion.\n\nMICU COURSE:\nHe was inbuted in the ED and transferred to the MICU. He was\nplaced on vancomycin, zosyn, cipro and continued on bactrim for\nPCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**]. Mini-BAL was negative for pneumocystis, AFB.\nBactrim was changed to prophylatic dose for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had\npersistent right sided effusion which was thought [**3-5**] hepatic\npneumothorax. Thoracentesis was done and pleural fluid was\nnegative for culture, malignancy. Patient had question of\npneumonia and was treated with zosyn for 10 days. Patient was\ndifficult to wean from the ventilator as his effusions rapidly\naccumulate. He was extubated on [**12-25**]. His course was also\ncomplicated by encephalopathic picture. MRI brain showed\nquestion of encephalitis. He was treated with acyclovir until\nthe LP viral cultures came back negative. He was also followed\nby hepatology as he had increasingly elevated LFTs and MR\nabdomen is concerning for HCC. He was transferred to the\nmedicine floor on [**2115-12-26**].\n\nMEDICINE FLOOR COURSE:\n\n# Respiratory: Patient had persistent fevers since admission\nwithout an identified infectious etiology. He was treated with\n10 days of zosyn for presumed pneumonia. He was very difficult\nto wean off the ventilator. This was thought to be secondary to\nrapidily accumulating pleural effusions secondary hepatic\nhydrothorax. Patient is not a good candidate for TIPS procedure\ngiven his significant comorbidities. He was given oxygen\nsupplementation and treated with albuterol nebulization.\n\n# HCV Cirrhosis: Patient has ascites and hepatic\nhydropneumothorax. Diminished functional capacity of liver was\nfurther evidenced by coagulopathy (INR 1.9-2.0). TIPS and\npleurodesis were not recommended per hepatology in the setting\nof this other comorbidities. For the same reason, patient would\nbe a poor liver transplant surgery. He was treated with\nspironolactone and lasix for diuresis. He was given lactulose\nfor hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n#Altered Mental Status: hepatic encephalopathy is most likely\netiology though AIDS dementia, delirum may have also\ncontributed. His mental status waxed and waned. He was often not\noriented to place or time. His hepatic encephalopathy was\ntreated with lactulose. He was oriented to person, hospital,\nyear and city on discharge.\n\n# Liver Nodule: very suspicious for HCC though AFP not elevated.\nPatient has follow-up with hepatology.\n\n# HIV/AIDS: On HAART. Last CD4 was 262 on [**2115-12-16**]. VL\nundetectable. Patient meets AIDS criteria with prior CD4<200\n(114 [**8-/2114**]) and previous infection with pneumocystis. HIV was\nlikely contributing to altered mental status and HCV cirrhosis\nprogression. He was treated with Raltegravir 400 mg PO BID,\nMaraviroc 600 mg PO BID, Etravirine 200 mg PO BID (doubled per\nID recs). He was continued on bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nETRAVIRINE [INTELENCE] - 100mg [**Hospital1 **]\nRALTEGRAVIR [ISENTRESS] 400mg [**Hospital1 **]\nMARAVIROC [SELZENTRY] - 600mg [**Hospital1 **]\nBactrim SS 1 tab daily\nLasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]\nSpironolactone 100mg daily\nLactulose 30ml [**Hospital1 **]\namitryptyline 50mg qhs\nranitidine 150mg daily\nMultivitamin\nDilaudid 2mg [**Hospital1 **] prn\nCelexa 40mg daily\nNeurontin 300mg TID\nNystatin 10,000U swish and swallow\nTylenol prn\nMarinol 10mg qachs\nMS Contin 30mg TID\nTums\nDiphenydramine 25mg prn\nAlubterol\nsimetheicone 80mg prn\nartificial tears\ncompazine 10mg prn\nmaalox\ndulcolax\nKlonopin 0.5mg TID prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. maraviroc 300 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\n2. raltegravir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times\na day).\n3. etravirine 100 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times\na day).\n4.
