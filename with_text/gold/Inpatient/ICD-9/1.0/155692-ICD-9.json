As per the patient his\nabdominal symptoms occurred only when he was at dialysis about\n[**3-1**] of the way through. Patient was also having symptoms of\nabdominal cramping. Both of these sytmpoms were felt to be\nrelated to poor abdominal blood floor. Paitent was admitted to\nvascular surgery and underwent routine angiogram on [**2152-1-18**] with\nstent placement to SMA. Patient appparently in the PACU had very\ndifficult to control pain requiring multiple nitroglycerins with\nsome relief.  Patient ruled in with NSTEMI with troponins\npeaking to 0.89 and CK- MB to 34. Cardiology was consulted and\npatient underwent cardiac catherization and was found to have\n3VD. C-surgery was consulted and pt was deemed not a surgical\ncandidate for CABG, thus it was decided that pt would undergo\nstaged PCI. Plan current was for staged PCI to begin on Monday.\n\nOn transfer patient denies any current symptoms. Denies current\nchest pain, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. Patient has\nseverly depressed exercise tolerance. Patient states he can\nbarely walk a few feet without getting short of breath. Patient\nalso endorses chest pain with exertion that occurs when patient\nwalks just a few steps.  Patient states this pain improves with\nrest.  Patient also endorses sleeping sitting up as he feels\nuncomfortable if he is lying down flat. Patient states that\nsometimes he sleeps upright in a chair because it is more\ncomfortable. IN addition, patient endorses + PND. Denies current\nlower extremity swelling although he states that he previously\nhas had bilateral lower extremity swelling.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCAD\nHTN\nDMII - insulin dependent\nhyperlipedemia\nCRF - HD M/W/F\nCOPD- home O2 2L at night\nCarotid stenosis s/p LCEA\nCHF, dialstolic\nPaget's disease\nb/l total knee replacement\nremoval of neck cyst in [**2080**]\n\nSocial History:\nSocial history is significant for the absence of current tobacco\nuse.

Patient had unstable angina though he remained\nhemodynamically stable.  Patient underwent a cardiac\ncatheterization with which showed extensive cardiac disease (The\nLAD had a 95% calcified mid vessel lesion.  The LCx had a 99%\nmid vessel lesion. The RCA serial 90% proximal and mid vessel\nlesions.) He was evaluated for CABG and thought not to be a\ncandidate given multiple medical problems including PVD and\nRenal failure on HD.  Instead, staged PCI was planned and\nmedical therapy optimized including ASA, clopidogrel, and\nheparin gtt until PCIs were completed.  Because he had\npersistent chest pain and ST depressions v4-v6 despite nitro gtt\nafter catheterization, he was transferred to the CCU while\nawaiting the procedures.\n.\nOn arrival to the ccu he was chest pain free but continued to\nhave nitermittent symptoms.  Nitro drip was titrated to pain\nrelief.  ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril\nwere continued.  He underwent staged PCI with 2 bare metal\nstents to the LCx and then another PCI with two bare metal\nstents to the RCA.  He will need continued plavix tx for at\nleast 1 month. Per pt request he will follow up with his\ncardiologist by his home.\n.\n#.ESRD- Patient had a history of ESRD likely [**1-31**] hypertension\nand diabetes, on MWF dialysis.  On [**1-21**] he became hypotensive\nduring HD and was only able to have 1 L removed.  Because he had\nelevated R heart pressures on cath, the plan was made to\nundertake ultrafiltration with the plan to remove more fluid and\nprevent pulmonary edema.  Afte that he had his regular HD, with\ngood results. He has an appointment to restart his MWF HD after\ndischarge. Sevalamer was continued; nephrocaps were started.\n.\n#. Pump - Patient had evidence clinically of heart failure by\nhistory with PND, dyspnea on exertion as well as previous\nhistory of lower extremity edema, although ventrigulograph done\nwith cath showed normal EF and wall motion. On arrival to the\nccu, patient appeared euvolemic to slightly overloaded. ACEI and\nbeta blocker were continued.\n.\n# Diabetes - Patient was not on outpatient medications.  Sliding\nscale was instituted. Pt was discharged on diabetic diet. He\nwill f/u with  his PCP.\n.\n# Hyperlipdemia - Patient with history of hyperlipedemia.  Lipid\npanel showed LDL 65 on 20 mg atorvastatin as an outpatient.\nGiven NSTEMI, he was changed to atorvastatin 80mg.\n.\n# Carotid stenosis s/p LCEA:  Statin and ASA were continued.\n.\n# Anemia - Normocytic and hematocrit of 28 in the setting of\nchronic renal failure. Iron panel consistent with anemia of\nchronic disease. Also with decreased EPO production.

As per the patient\n   his abdominal symptoms occurred only when he was at dialysis about [**3-1**]\n   of the way through. Patient was also having symptoms of abdominal\n   cramping. Both of these sytmpoms were felt to be related to poor\n   abdominal blood flow. Patient was admitted to vascular surgery and\n   underwent routine angiogram on [**2152-1-18**] with stent placement to SMA.\n   Patient appparently in the PACU had very difficult to control pain\n   requiring multiple nitroglycerins with some relief. Patient ruled in\n   with NSTEMI with troponins peaking to 0.89 and CK- MB to 34. Cardiology\n   was consulted and patient underwent cardiac catherization [**1-20**] and was\n   found to have 3VD. C-surgery was consulted and pt was deemed not a\n   surgical candidate for CABG, thus it was decided that pt would undergo\n   staged PCI. Plan current was for staged PCI to begin on Monday.\n   .\n   On the cardiology floor the patient reported persistent chest pain,\n   which was exacerbated when his nitroglycerin was weaned off and\n   resolved with increased nitroglycerin. On [**1-22**], the patient was\n   reporting persistent chest pain, and  EKG showed increased ST\n   depressions in V4-V6.  Given his increased frequency of chest pain and\n   ekg changes he was transferred ot the CCU for closer monitoring.\n   .\n   On transfer to the CCu the patient denied any current symptoms. Denied\n   current chest pain, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. Patient has\n   severly depressed exercise tolerance. Patient states he can barely walk\n   a few feet without getting short of breath. Patient also endorses chest\n   pain with exertion that occurs when patient walks just a few steps.\n   Patient states this pain improves with rest. Patient also endorses\n   sleeping sitting up as he feels uncomfortable if he is lying down flat.\n   Patient states that sometimes he sleeps upright in a chair because it\n   is more comfortable. IN addition, patient endorses + PND. Denies\n   current lower extremity swelling although he states that he previously\n   has had bilateral lower extremity swelling.\n   .\n   Of Note, On [**1-21**] the patient underwent routine hemodialysis during\n   which he became hypotensive to 73/34 after 2.5 liters of fluid were\n   removed.  He was given 1.5L of NS back, and his blood pressure\n   increased to 85/46.  Given that his cardiac catheterization revealed\n   elevated right and left sided pressures, it was reccommended by\n   cardiology to continue with CVVH over the weekend to remove more\n   volume.\n   Past medical history: HTN\n   DMII - insulin dependent\n   hyperlipedemia\n   CRF - HD M/W/F\n   COPD- home O2 2L at night\n   Carotid stenosis s/p LCEA\n   CAD\n   CHF\n   Paget's disease\n   CAD Risk Factors\n   CAD Risk Factors Present\n   Diabetes mellitus, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension\n   CAD Risk Factors Absent\n   Family Hx of CAD, Family Hx of sudden cardiac death\n   (Tobacco: No), (Quit: Yes), (Cigarettes: 1/2 packs / day x 60 yrs)\n   Cardiovascular Procedural History\n   PCI: Most recent: Cardiac catherization [**2152-1-20**]\n   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three\n   vessel CAD. The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities. The LAD was a\n   tortuous vessel with a 95% calcified mid vessel lesion. The LCx had a\n   99% mid vessel lesion. The RCA serial 90% proximal and mid vessel\n   lesions.\n   2. Hemodynamic evaluation revealed severely elevated right and left\n   sided filling pressures. The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was\n   severely elevated at 65mm Hg. Mean PCWP was elevated at 31 mm Hg.\n   Systemic arterial pressures were elevated at 132 mm Hg.
