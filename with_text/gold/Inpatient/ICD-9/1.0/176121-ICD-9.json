The patient recovered well and had an\ninitial improvement in his symptoms and leukocytosis. On POD2\nthe\npatient started experiencing worsening abdominal pain, nausea\nand\nvomiting and was transferred to the OSH ICU where a CT was\nobtained showing postoperative changes and continued\ninflammation\nbut no clear abscess. He was taken to the operating room for a\nexploratory laporotomy on [**2-21**] where, per report, an enterotomy\nor\nperforation was identified in the terminal ileum. An ileal\nresection was performed and an end ileostomy was placed, and the\npatient was taken to the ICU for further recovery. Following the\nprocedure the patient continued to have abdominal pain and\nincreasing leukocytosis up to [**Numeric Identifier 3301**]. His midline laparotomy\nwound\nwas opened [**1-22**] wound infection. The patient had been receiving\nZosyn and Flagyl and was then switched to Imipenem per ID\nrecommendation. A repeat CT was obtained on [**2-27**] and\ndemonstrated\nmultiple fluid collections and the patient was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.\n\nPast Medical History:\nPMH: Hypogammaglobulinemia\n\nPSH: Appendectomy [**2110-2-17**], ex-lap LOA, end ileostomy [**2110-2-21**]\n\n\nSocial History:\nsenior in high school, no ETOH, tobacco or drugs, active\nfootball player\n\n\nFamily History:\nno immunodeficiencies, 2 siblings - one with ? diagnosis of SLE,\nother healthy\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nOn Discharge:\nAVSS\nGEN: resting comfortably, NAD\nCV: RRR\nLungs: CTAB\nABD: Open midline abdominal wound with wet/dry dressing in\nplace. Appropriately tender around the wound. Ostomy\npink/viable.\nEXT: warm, well perfused\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2110-2-28**] 04:05AM BLOOD WBC-18.0* RBC-3.82* Hgb-11.3* Hct-34.3*\nMCV-90 MCH-29.7 MCHC-33.0 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-543*\n[**2110-3-4**] 06:35AM BLOOD WBC-8.6 RBC-3.59* Hgb-10.6* Hct-32.2*\nMCV-90 MCH-29.6 MCHC-33.0 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-642*\n[**2110-2-28**] 04:05AM BLOOD Glucose-106 UreaN-11 Creat-0.9 Na-137\nK-5.1 Cl-101 HCO3-27 AnGap-14\n[**2110-3-4**] 06:35AM BLOOD Glucose-86 UreaN-9 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-4.8\nCl-102 HCO3-28 AnGap-14\n\nCT abd/pel ([**3-5**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Two discrete collections are again visualized throughout the\nabdomen and pelvis. The previously aspirated, but not drained\ncollection along the right paracolic gutter appears relatively\nunchanged with a focus of air consistent with prior\ninstrumentation. The right lower quadrant collection with\nextension to pelvis which was aspirated and had a drain placed\nappears smaller with resolution of the lateral and superficial\nportion of the collection anterior to the right psoas muscle.\n\n2. Moderate left pleural effusion, which is increased in size in\ncomparison to prior study with adjacent atelectasis. Small right\npleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 89930**] was transferred to our trauma surgical intensive\ncare unit from [**Hospital3 **] early in the AM of [**2110-2-28**]. He\nwas seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his team, and based on the fluid\ncollections seen on OSH CT scan, he was sent to IR for\npercutaneous drainage. The IR team aspirated the right paracolic\ngutter collection and left a drain in the pelvic collection.\nThis fluid was sent for culture. The patient was initially\ntachycardic upon admission to the ICU, but was otherwise\nhemodynamically stable. He was transferred to the floor on HD4\nin good condition.\n\nNeuro: His pain was initially well controlled on intermittent IV\ndilaudid. When tolerating po intake, the patient was switched to\nvicodin, which was well tolerated.\n\nCV: He arrived tachycardic with stable blood pressure. This\nimproved quickly during his hospital stay, and he had no other\nissues.\n\nResp: He had significant oxygen demand upon arrival and CXR\nshowed bilateral effusions and atelectasis. Sputum cultures were\ndrawn that were insufficient. Patient was concurrently being\ntreated with vancomycin and meropenem for his intra-abdominal\nabscesses, which was determined to be sufficient for presumed\npneumonia as well. The patient was also given intermittent lasix\nto improve his respiratory status as his lungs looked fluid\noverloaded. These effusions were followed with serial CXRs and\nimproved throughout his stay. He was weaned off of oxygen on the\nfloor and his breathing remained comfortable.\n\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially NPO/IVF upon admission. His\ndiet was advanced to regular by HD3 and this was well tolerated.\nOstomy output was nearly 2 liters the first 24 hours of\nadmission. The output remained high the first few days of his\nhospital stay, but then decreased on its own to an appropriate\nlevel without medical intervention. His electrolytes and fluid\nstatus were closely monitored and patient was repleted as\nneeded. His open abdominal wound was treated with wet/dry\ndressing changes TID, and showed continued healing and\nimprovement during his stay.\n\nID: He was seen by our ID team upon arrival who recommended\nswitching imipenem to meropenem. He was also started on\nvancomycin at arrival for presumed PNA. His abdominal wound was\npacked with wet to dry dressings. Abdominal fluid collections\nshowed vanc sensitive enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) **], so fluconazole\nwas added as well. The patient was kept on this antibiotic\nregimen during his hospital stay. PICC line was placed on [**3-3**]\nto continue atbx as an outpatient. Repeat CT scan was performed\non [**3-5**] that showed persistent abscesses in the pelvis and R\npericolic gutter. However, after patient's drain was adequately\nflushed, the drain began to put out purulent material. Radiology\nfelt the drain was in good position and did not need to be\nre-adjusted. The patient was sent home on meropenem, vancomycin,\nand fluconazole per ID's recommendations.\nProphylaxis: Patient was started on SQH and encouraged to\nambulate often.\n\nDispo: Patient received ostomy teaching, Picc line teaching, and\nwound care teaching. He understood all of this and agreed with\nthe plan. He was given discharge instructions and told to keep\nall follow up appointments as scheduled.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nzyrtec\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO\nQ6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*50 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. ibuprofen 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8\nhours).\n3. vancomycin 500 mg Recon Soln Sig: 1.5g Recon Solns\nIntravenous Q 8H (Every 8 Hours): Through [**3-8**].\nDisp:*12 Grams* Refills:*0*\n4. meropenem 500 mg Recon Soln Sig: 500mg Recon Solns\nIntravenous Q6H (every 6 hours): Through [**3-17**].\nDisp:*23 grams* Refills:*0*\n5. fluconazole 200 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day:\nThrough [**3-17**].\nDisp:*22 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML\nIntravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.\nDisp:*30 syringes* Refills:*0*\n7.
