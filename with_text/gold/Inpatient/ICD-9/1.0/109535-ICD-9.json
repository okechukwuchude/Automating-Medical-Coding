Patient was\nintubated for airway protection and a temporary transcutaneous\npacer was placed.  Cardiac enzymes were negative and TSH normal.\n A head CT was done to rule out CNS bleed. An echocardiogram was\nalso done that showed mild regional systolic dysfunction, c/w\nCAD, mild MR, EF 45%.  [**6-16**] patient was extubated.  A permanent\n[**Company **] pacemaker was placed on this admission.\n.\n# CAD: Cardiac markers were negative on admission.  Echo showed,\nmild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.  Once head bleed was\nruled out he was continued on aspirin, plavix.  His\nace-inhibitor was continued.  Nodal agents were initially held,\ngiven the heart block.  Post-pacemaker placement, he was\nrestarted on amlodipine.  He was switched from atenolol to\ncarvedilol.\n.\n# Diabetes mellitus: Patient continued on ISS. He currently\ntakes no medicines at home for glucose control.\n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: Continuec statin\n.\n# Gout: Patient complained on knee pain consistent w/ his prior\nhistory of gout.  He was treated with a short course of\nprednisone.\n.\n# HTN: PCP confirmed that patient was supposed to switched from\nHCTZ to chlorthalidone.  This was held given his suspected gout\nflare.  He was treated with ace-i, ccb, and atenolol switched to\ncarvedilol (see above).\n.\n# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Based on atrius records, patient\nnoted to have renal complications of diabetes with a Creatine of\n1.7 for the past several years.  His Cr at [**Hospital1 18**] ranged from\n1.5-1.8.\n.\n# Anemia: No obvious signs of bleeding. Pt has not had a BM here\nand rectal exam negative for impaction with negative guiaic.\nIron studies show mild Fe deficiency.
