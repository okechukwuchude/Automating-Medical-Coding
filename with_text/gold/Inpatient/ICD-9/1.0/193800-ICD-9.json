Per witnesses report, the patient was riding his\n   bike with a helmet at a low speed and hit a pot hole; he did not lose\n   consciousness, but stood up and then suddenly collapsed. Per witnesses,\n   patient was initially unresponsive but with a pulse. Upon EMS arrival,\n   he arrested; CPR was started, and a pulse was regained. However the\n   patient went into cardiac arrest again. He was pulseless and\n   non-breathing for approximately 5-10 minutes. ACLS protocol was started\n   and a pulse was found. In ED, he remains intubated, in NSR and on\n   norepi for blood pressure.

Therapeutic Hypothermia: Pt had a cardiac arrest of unclear\n   etiology, although may be related to a high cervical spine injury since\n   pt has evidence of a dens fracture on CT scan. Induction of hypothermia\n   carries a theoretical risk of coagulopathy and while this pat sustained\n   trauma, there is currently no evidence of active hemorrhage. However,\n   in discussion with the attending trauma surgeon, there is a concern for\n   the possibility of delayed bleeding around site of cord injury if the\n   pt becomes coagulopathic; therefore, will defer cooling for now,\n   pending MRI of spine. If MRI is negative for cord edema, this issue\n   could be revisited, although pt is now at least 5 hours out from\n   initial arrest.\n   2.       Avoid elevated ICP:\n   -          HOB > 30 degrees\n   -          Maintain normocarbia goal pCO2 35-40\n   3.

Per witnesses report, the patient was riding his\n   bike with a helmet at a low speed and hit a pot hole; he did not lose\n   consciousness, but stood up and then suddenly collapsed. Per witnesses,\n   patient was initially\n   unresponsive but with a pulse. Upon EMS arrival, he arrested; CPR was\n   started, and a pulse was regained. However the patient went into\n   cardiac arrest again. He was pulseless and non-breathing for\n   approximately 5-10 minutes. ACLS protocol was started and a pulse was\n   found. In ED, he remains intubated, in NSR and on norepi for blood\n   pressure. Found to have Acute type 2 dens fracture. Admitted to TICU\n   for further management.\n   Other medications:\n   1.
