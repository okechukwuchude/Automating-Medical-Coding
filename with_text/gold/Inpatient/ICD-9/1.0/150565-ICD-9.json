She was\ntachycardic and mildly hypotensive upon arrival and she was\ntransfused another unit of pRBC. She eventually stabilized and\nher hematocrit was serially monitored. It remained stable at 38\nfor the day. Her pain was controlled with fentanyl and IV\ndilaudid. She was alert and responsive. Her cardiovascular and\npulmonary status were closely monitored and she remained stable.\nShe was initially NPO while we monitored for active bleed. A CTA\nshowed increased hematoma around the liver and spleen although\nno areas of active extravasation. However, her hematocrit was\nslowly trending down to 28 and then stabilized. She did not\ncomplain of any belly pain and she was not tachycardic. She was\nready for transfer out of the ICU on HD 3.\n\nOn the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with no\nevidence of active bleeding. Her hematocrits were trended and\nremained stable. On HD4 her diet was advanced as tolerated and\nher activity status was changed from bedrest to activity as\ntolerated. Her pain medications were changed to oral, and her\npain continued to be well controlled and she was able to perform\nincentive spirometry. She did not have increased pain with\neating or ambulating relating to her liver laceration.\n\nOccupational therapy evaluated the patient for loss of\nconsciouness who determined her safe for discharge home but\nrecommended outpatient follow up with cognitive neurology, which\nwas set up prior to discharge.\n\nOn [**2183-7-18**] Ms. [**Known lastname 112114**] is afebrile with stable vital signs. Her\nhematocrit is stable at 34.5. She is tolerating a regular diet\nand her pain is well controlled on an oral regimen. She is being\ndischarged home with follow up scheduled in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLexapro 20 mg daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO TID\n2. Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID\n3. Escitalopram Oxalate 20 mg PO DAILY\n4.

You\nsustained multiple injuries including an injury to your liver, a\nsmall injury to your spleen, and broken ribs on both sides.\n\nYou sustained an injury to your liver/spleen. You should go to\nthe nearest Emergency department if you suddenly feel dizzy or\nlightheaded, as if you are going to pass out. These are signs\nthat you may be having internal bleeding from your liver/spleen\ninjury.\n\nYour liver/spleen injury will heal in time. It is important that\nyou do not participate in any contact sports or any other\nactivity for the next 6 weeks that may cause injury to your\nabdominal region.\n\nAvoid aspirin products, NSAID's such as Advil, Motrin,\nIbuprofen, Naprosyn, or Coumadin for at least 1-2 weeks unless\notherwise directed as these can cause bleeding internally.\n\nYou sustained rib fractures which can cause severe pain and\nsubsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the\npain.\nYou should take your pain medicine as directed to stay ahead of\nthe pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.  If\nthe pain medication is too sedating, take half the dose and\nnotify your physician.\n[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is a complication of rib fractures. In order to\ndecrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4\ntimes every hour while awake. This will help expand the small\nairways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that\npool in the lungs.\nYou will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold\nagainst your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and\ndeep breathing.\nSymptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short\nperiods may ease the pain.\nDo NOT smoke.\nReturn to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath,\nincreased pain or crackling sensation around your rips\n(crepitus).\nNarcotic pain medication can cause constipation. Thefore you\nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid\nand fiber intake if possible.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: GENERAL SURGERY/[**Hospital Unit Name 2193**]\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2183-7-31**] at 3:45 PM\nWith: ACUTE CARE CLINIC [**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\nYou will need a chest x-ray prior to this appointment.
