She reports that she\n\"almost passed out\" and was \"dizzy\" at times. She reports \"loss\nof balance\" and \"inability to get up.\" During admission, she was\ntreated with IVF and fludrocortisone for the hypotension. She\nhad CT abdomen and pelvis for mild abdominal pain. She was felt\nto have ? diverticulitis for which she was started on flagyl. On\nher labs, she was noted to be in acute renal failure. The [**Last Name (un) **]\nwas felt to be in part due to gentamycin, and this was\ndiscontinued. They continued the IV vancomycin. She was\ndischarged home.\n\n She presented on [**7-13**] for a generalized rash over her body,\nswollen lips, and some lesions in her mouth felt to be due to\nthe recently started flagyl. The rash was felt to be c/w\nerythema multiform per dermatology. There was no airway\ncompromise, but she did report some difficulty swallowing. She\nwas kept on IV steroids, which was changed to oral prednisone on\ndate of transfer. Rash and erythema improved per dermatology\nteam. Reportedly, her SBP was in the 80s, and she was\nresuscitated with IVF. HR was in the 130s-140s on arrival to\nOSH.\n\n  She also had acute renal failure on admission to the OSH. She\nwas continued on mIVF. Cr on presentation to [**Location (un) **] was 1.8 and\nimproved to 1.5 on transfer. Her atrial fibrillation is\nreportedly poorly controlled, and she remains on IV amiodarone,\nnow transitioned to oral amiodarone, along with metoprolol and\ndiltiazem gtt. Initial plan was for electrical cardioversion,\nbut daughter requested transfer to a tertiary medical center for\nthis.\n\n  Additionally, the patient had an episode of pulmonary edema on\nevening prior to transfer. She reported that it was \"hard to\nbreathe.\" This was suspected to be from poorly controlled heart\nrate and perhaps mIVF. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary vascular\ncongestion. She diuresed well with 40 mg IV lasix (-1800 cc\nsince then). She was initially on 6L NC. She reports cough, but\nno productive sputum. HR reportedly increasing to 138 bpm at\ntimes.\n\nReview of systems:\n(+) Per HPI. Reports 20 lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 958**].\n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies sinus tenderness,\nrhinorrhea or congestion. Denies productive cough, shortness of\nbreath. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or\nweakness.

Mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There are\nmultifocal opacities noted, with some perihilar and upper lung\nredistribution as well as both basal involvement. There are also\nbilateral pleural effusions, right more than left. There is no\npneumothorax. The findings are worrisome for a combination of\npulmonary edema given the perihilar and upper lobar distribution\nas well as multifocal infection giving relatively focal and\npatchy character of the finding. Correlation with prior imaging\nas well as assessment after diuresis is recommended. Surgical\nclips are projecting over the right axilla and no right breast\nidentified, suggesting that the patient can be after right\nmastectomy, please correlate with clinical history.\n.\nCXR [**2149-7-20**]: CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The heart is somewhat\nenlarged. There is no evidence of failure. The lung fields are\nclear. The costophrenic angles are sharp. There has been a\nmarked improvement in the overall appearances since the prior\nchest x-ray of [**7-17**]. IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, otherwise\nnormal chest.\n.\nTTE [**2149-7-17**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is considerable\nbeat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection\nfraction due to an irregular rhythm. The right ventricular free\nwall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is\ndilated with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending\naorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are\nmildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to\nmoderate ([**1-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic\nmitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. The transmitral gradient is\nnormal for this prosthesis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated\npulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no\npericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No\ndefinite vegetations seen\n.\nTEE ([**2149-7-18**]): The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe\nspontaneous echo contrast but no thrombus is seen in the body of\nthe left atrium and left atrial appendage. The left atrial\nappendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No\nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the right\natrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function appears\ndepressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with global\nfree wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic\narch and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A\nwell-seated bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present.\nThe mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet\nmotion and transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation\nis seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened.\nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.\nThere is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Prominent\nspontaneous echo contrast but no thrombus in the body of the\nleft atrium and left atrial appendage. Well seated, normal\nfunctioning mitral valve bioprosthesis. Depressed biventriular\nsystolic function. Aortic regurgitation.\nPatient is at high risk for developing intracardiac thrombus\npost cardioversion.\n.\nEKG [**2149-7-16**]: atrial fibrillation at 99, mild right axis\ndeviation, normal intervals, no pathologic Q waves, non-specific\nST changes precordially\n.\nURINE CULTURE (Final [**2149-7-19**]):\n\nPSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..\nPiperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing confirmed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3077**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].\n.\n            SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in MCG/ML\n\n______________________________________________________\n                             PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA\n                             |\nCEFEPIME--------------     8 S\nCEFTAZIDIME-----------   <=1 S\nCIPROFLOXACIN---------<=0.25 S\nGENTAMICIN------------     4 S\nMEROPENEM-------------     1 S\nPIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----   <=4 S\nTOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S\n\n[**2149-7-16**] 6:51 pm BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Venipuncture.\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2149-7-22**]**\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2149-7-22**]):    NO GROWTH.\n\n[**2149-7-16**] 8:45 pm BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Venipuncture.\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2149-7-22**]**\n\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2149-7-22**]):    NO GROWTH.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 7594**] is a 79 y/o female with rheumatic heart disease s/p\nporcine MVR, moderate AI and atrial fibrillation. In [**Month (only) 116**] she was\ntreated for enterococcus endocarditis with Vancomycin and\nGentamicin which were discontinued due to ARF, and was later\nadmitted to [**Location (un) **] for metronidazole induced\nbronchoconstriction, rash, and hypotension as well as [**Last Name (un) **] and\nafib with RVR. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of\nafib with rvr for which she underwent successful DC\ncardioversion.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n# Afib with RVR:  The precipitant of her afib was unclear, but\nmay have been related to her volume status or recent infection.\nShe was on amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem, and was\ndifficult to rate control.  She was successfully DC cardioverted\non [**2149-7-18**] after a TTE and TEE were negative for thrombus.\nAfter the cardioversion the diltiazem drip was able to be\ndiscontinued and she was discharged on metoprolol succinate 50mg\ndaily and amiodarone 200mg daily.  She was anticoagulated with\nheparin for the cardioversion and was then switched to her\nprevious home dose of warfarin 2mg daily. She was\nsupratherapeutic at this dose with an INR at discharge of 3.5.\nWarfarin was held on [**7-21**] and [**7-22**]. The increased response to\nwarfarin is likely due to poor PO intake as well as increase in\namiodarone dosage. She will require INR checks daily while in\nrehab until a new stable regimen can be ascertained. She should\nbe re-started on warfarin at 1mg daily after her INR is less\nthan 3.0. Goal INR [**2-20**].  Patient should follow-up with\ncardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in 2 weeks.\n.\n# Diffuse rash with oral lesions: This was felt to be erythema\nmultiforme due to metronidazole per [**Location (un) **] dermatology consult.\nIt is improving on steroids. Prednisone was tapered as follows:\n60 mg x 3 days, 40 mg x 2 days, 20 mg x 2 days, 10 mg x 2 days,\nthen stop. On discharge ([**2149-7-22**]) she was given the 1st day of\n20mg. For pruritus, triamcinolone, sarna, and atarax were\ncontinued. The patient continues to have oral lesions,\npredominantly on the tongue that cause pain with eating. She was\ngiven a maalox/benadryl/lidocaine mouthwash QID and a\ndexamethasone swish and spit TID which provided some symptomatic\nrelief. The patient was advised to follow up within 1 week with\nDr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who saw her at [**Location (un) **].\n.\n# Acute kidney injury: Pt has an unclear baseline, though per\nrecords had recent [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to gent toxicity.  Cr on\npresentation to [**Location (un) **] was 1.8 and improved to 1.5 on transfer,\nand was 1.2 at the time of discharge from [**Hospital1 18**]. [**Month (only) 116**] have been\npre-renal component, as she improved with normalization of\nvolume status and cardiac output. Urine studies were all normal\n(urine sediment, urine electrolytes, smear for eosinophils).\nRenal function should be monitored in outpatient setting.\n.\n# Leukocytosis: The WBC decreased from 20.1 on admission to 8.7\non discharge. The patient remained afebrile and there was no\nevidence of infection on chest x-ray, blood culture, TTE, TEE,\nor U/A. The etiology was likely steroids vs. stress response.\nUrine cultures were positive for Pseudomonas sensitive to\nciprofloxacin however the UA was negative for LE and nitrites\nand she was asymptomatic so no treatment was indicated at this\ntime. However if she becomes symptomatic antibiotic\nsensitivities are included in this report above.\n.\n# Hypertension: After cardioversion the patient maintained blood\npressures consistently over 140/90 and therefore she was started\non losartan 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 5mg daily. Also on\nmetoprolol succnate 50mg daily.  Based on the home medication\nlist that we have, she was not previously taking any\nanti-hypertensives. Her worsening hypertension may be explained\nby treatment with steroids or alternatively because her cardiac\noutput improved after cardioversion. Her blood pressure may\nnormalize as steroids are tapered therefore she may need\nadjustment to her anti-hypertensive regimen. She should have BP\nchecked daily and she was advised to follow-up with her\ncardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in 2 weeks.\n.\n# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient had an\nepisode of pulmonary edema on evening prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]\nand was on 6L NC. CXR at that time showed bilateral pulmonary\nvascular congestion.  TTE here shows low-normal EF of 50%.\nPatient with history of diastolic dysfunction, and episode of\nafib with RVR likely contributed to acute dCHF exacerbation.\nShe diuresed well with IV lasix. CXR prior to discharge showed\nno pulmonary edema and she did not have any clinical evidence of\nheart failure. She did not require any diuretics at the time of\ndischarge. Was discharged on metoprolol and losartan.  Will\nfollow-up with cardioolgy.\n.\n# Recent enterococcus endocarditis: Per review of OSH records,\nthe patient originally presented to [**Location (un) **] in may of this year\nwith 1 month of weakness and fatigue, and was found to have\nenterococcus bacteremia. She was treated with almost 1 month of\nVanc/Gent (PCN allergic). This was stopped 3 days prior to the\nplanned course, as she developed ARF. All subsequent blood\ncultures at the OSH and [**Hospital1 18**] were negative. She did exhibit any\nstigmata of endocarditis during her admission and TTE and TEE\nwere negative.\n.\n# Rheumatic heart disease s/p porcine MVR: Her goal INR is\n2.0-3.0. Her INR was 3.5 at the time of discharge. She should be\nrestarted on warfarin 1mg daily once INR <3.\n.\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n.\n# ? diverticulitis: AT [**Hospital1 18**] her abdominal exam was benign. No\nintervention was instituted at this time, particularly given her\nside effect to flagyl.\n.\n# Hypothyroidism: Her synthroid was continued, and her TSH was\nwnl.\n.\n# ? Hx of Depression: The patient was taking sertraline 50mg\ndaily at home. This was discontinued at the outside hospital and\nit was not reinstituted after transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. I was not able\nto find the rationale for discontinuing the medication in the\nrecords we have. The patient reports that she had been started\non it several months ago and therefore it does not appear that\nit was related to the patient's rash. Regardless, she does not\ncurrently meet criteria for major depressive disorder and the\npatient states that she would prefer to not take it. However,\nthere is no contra-indication to her resuming another\nanti-depressant in the future.\n.\n# Nutrition: Patient has limited PO intake secondary to pain\nfrom oral lesions (in setting of erythema multiforme),\nparticularly with very hot and very cold foods as well as spicy\nfoods. She was able to tolerate ensure/boost pudding. Can\ncontinue on dexamethasone swish and spit and\nmaalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine mouthwash as needed for oral\npain\n.\nLABS PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: None\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Please monitor INR daily and restart warfarin at 1mg daily when\nINR <3.
