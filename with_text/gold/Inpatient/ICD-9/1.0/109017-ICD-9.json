She was speaking to her son-in-law this am\n~9am who found her initially to be speaking normally (although\nconversation was brief but able to ask about her daughter who is\nout of the country) - incidentally she called him.  However,\nsoon\nafter the call, he was answering a question and then noted no\nresponse on the other end of the telephone.  He called her name,\nbut heard no response.  A friend had been planning to pick her\nup\nat 10 am, so he figured the phone was having technical\ndifficulties and that he would be contact[**Name (NI) **]/seen by the people\nshe was supposed to meet.  He didn't hear anything and presumed\nthat things were ok.  ~12:30, her daughter in law came by her\napt\nto see how she was doing.  When she knocked, she heard someone\n(the pt) trying to say something but not really saying anything\nclearly.  She called 911 and the fire dept responded, broke open\nthe door and found the patient dressed (ready to go out per\nchildren), unable to communicate - not making word salad, but\nonly word that was understandable was \"no\" with r sided\nweakness.\nAs a result, she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was SBPs in\n150.  she could follow simple commands, but was not moving her\nRUE.  she also appeared to have trouble getting words out per ED\nstaff. She was then intubated for airway protection.
