Focal contained, post-traumatic aortic dissection in the\nproximal\ndescending aorta is unchanged since previous CT dated [**2150-6-3**].\n2. Stable fractures involving the anterior ends of first and\nsecond ribs on left side.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nOn [**5-31**], the patient went to the OR for femur fx repair, she had\nlow O2 sats postoperatively, requiring a non rebreather. On [**6-1**],\nthe patient's C-spine was cleared and her diet was slowly\nadvanced. Logroll precautions were d/c'd and patient was started\non dilaudid PCA. ON [**6-2**], the patient had an acute drop in her\nHCT down to 23.7, she received a unit of blood and responded\nappropriately. She continued to have some desaturation with\nturning/sleeping, but she was able to be transitioned from NRB\nto NC. On [**6-3**], the patient underwent CTA to rule out PE, which\nshowed dissection of the descending aorta. Cardiac surgery was\nconsulted and recommended no surgery, but instead strict blood\npressure control. On [**6-4**], patient was started on labetalol gtt\nfor better HR and BP control, and this was transitioned to po\nLopressor and labetalol gtt was discontinued. Otherwise, patient\nwas doing well, tolerating regular diet. Ortho recommended 50%\nweight bearing on right leg and full wt bearing on the left leg.\nThe patient was transferred to the floor on [**6-5**].\n\nFollowing transfer to the Trauma floor she continued to make\ngood progress.  Vascular surgery was consulted regarding her\ndescending thoracic aortic dissection and they recommended\nCoumadin, aspirin and keeping SBP < 140 mmHg.  Her Coumadin was\nstarted on [**2150-6-7**] at 5mg followed by 7.5 mg on [**6-8**] and [**6-9**].\nHer INR on [**6-10**] is 1.7 and she will take 5mg daily with an INR\ncheck on [**2150-6-12**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89092**], her PCP will dose her Coumadin\nstarting on Friday [**2150-6-12**]. Her last CTA chest was on [**2150-6-8**]\nwhich showed no progression of her dissection.\n\nBlood pressure control was successful with Lopressor and\nhydralazine with SBP 95-120/70 and heart rates in the 70's.  She\nwill be discharged on Labetolol alone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] and the VNA\nwill follow up with blood pressure checks for the first few\ndays.\n\nHer blood sugars have been elevated since admission in the high\n100-240 range.  She was encouraged to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89092**]\nfor further management.\n\nFrom an Orthopedic standpoint she has done well post op.  Her\nincision is healing well and after many Physical Therapy visits\nshe is able to crutch walk safely.  Her weight bearing status is\npartial (50%) on the right leg and full weight bearing on the\nleft.  Her staples will be removed by the VNA on [**2150-6-15**].\n\nAfter a long recovery she was discharged home on [**2150-6-10**] with\nVNA services for BP checks and Coumadin teaching and monitoring.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every\n4 hours) as needed for fever/pain.\n2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n3. famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\n5. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n6. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3\nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n7. labetalol 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n8. ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q12H\n(every 12 hours): thru [**2150-6-12**].\nDisp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n9. Coumadin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: INR\n[**2150-6-12**] to determine future.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n\nFacility:\n[**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 189**]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nS/P MVC\n1. Open right femur fracture\n2. Proximal descending thoracic aortic dissection with contained\nthrombus\n3. Left rib fractures [**12-1**]\n4. Right first rib fracture\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\n* You were admitted to the hospital after your car accident with\nmultiple injuries including a broken right leg, rib fractures\nand a small tear in your aorta which sealed over.\n\n* Your orthopedic surgery went well and your weight bearing\nstatus on the right leg is partial weight bearing with crutches.\n The VNA will take your staples out.\n\n* Your injury caused left rib fractures [**12-1**] and the right first\nrib which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to\ntake shallow breaths because of the pain.\n\n*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay\nahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep\nbreaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the\ndose and notify your physician.\n\n*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to\ndecrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4\ntimes every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small\nairways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that\npool in the lungs.\n\n*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to\nhold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing\nand deep breathing.\n\n*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short\nperiods may ease the pain.\n\n*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you\nshould take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid\nand fiber intake if possible.\n\n*  Do NOT smoke\n\n* The aortic dissection was noted on your initial CT scan.  You\nneed to have good blood pressure control and also must stay on a\nblood thinner called Coumadin.  You will need to have your blood\ntested frequently in the beginning of therapy but after you are\nregulated it should be once a month.  Maintain safety\nprecautions while on Coumadin so that you don't bleed.  Be\ncareful with sharp objects. Shave your legs with an electric\nrazor to prevent cuts that will bleed excessively. Do not use\nibuprofen or any product with Ibuprofen in it as it can increase\nyour bleeding tendency.\n\n * Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89092**] will regulate your Coumadin dose.\n\n* Your blood sugars have been on the high side since your\nadmission and you should talk to your PCP about further testing\nfor diabetes.\n\n*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute\nshortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation\naround your ribs ( crepitus ), chest pain, or increased leg\npain.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nCall the [**Hospital **] Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] for a follow up\nappointment in 4 weeks.\n\nCall the Vascular Surgery Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2625**] for a follow up\nappointment in 4 weeks.\n\nCall the Acute Care Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**] for a follow up\nappointment in [**1-1**] weeks.\n\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 89092**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 89093**])  Wednesday [**2150-6-17**] at 11:45AM.\n\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2150-6-10**]"
