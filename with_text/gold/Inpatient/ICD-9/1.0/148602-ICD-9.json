Four people at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1820**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab helped her up\nand put her back into bed. She denied any loss of consciousness,\nblurry vision, chest pain, shortness of breath. A CT scan done\nshowed multiple pelvic fractures, a question of a pulmonary\nembolism in the RLL and a bladder pollyp. She had seen her\nurologist one week prior for cystoscopy for hematuria. At [**Last Name (un) 1724**]\nshe had an IVC filter placed [**2172-5-7**] as well as a PICC line. Her\nUrine Cx from [**2172-5-4**] was ESBL E.Coli for which she has been\ntreated with Imipenem/Cilistatin.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCOPD, CO2 retainer on home oxygen 2 liters, GERD, DVT 6 years\nago, spinal stenosis, CHF, hypertension, osteoporosis, anxiety,\nbladder cancer, UTI, and shingles.\nPSH: varicose vein ligation, hysterectomy, IVC filter [**2172-5-7**]\n\n\nFamily History:\nNoncontributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nUpon admission:\nAfebrile, BP 111-141/48-70, HR 88-101, RR 19-29, Sat 89-98% on\n4L\nGeneral: Elderly Caucasian Female with pursed lip breathing,\nmild tacypnea\nPulmonary: Inspiratory crackles noted at the bases but overall\nis markedly improved from yesterday.\nCardiac: RR, nl S1 S2, systolic ejection murmur noted over\nsternum, no rubs or gallops appreciated\nAbdomen: distended, soft, non-tender, tympanetic to percussion\nExtremities: No edema noted in lower extremities\nNeurologic: Alert, oriented x 3.

Pelvic fractures: comminuted fx of left sacrum extending\ninto the first sacral arch. A second nondisplaced fx in the\ninferior right sacral ala. Proximal left superior pubic ramus fx\nand a comminuted fx of the left ischiopubic ramus. 2. Possible\nthrombus in two pulmonary vessels of the right lower lobe. It is\nunclear if these vessels are arteries or veins. 3. Small\nbilateral pulmonary effusions with adjacent consolidations. 4. 1\ncm bladder polyp.\n\nCXR:\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study earlier in this date,\nthere is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.\nAgain, there is\nhyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse interstitial markings\nthat could\nreflect chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous\npressure, or\nboth. Bilateral pleural effusions or scarring with probable\nbibasilar\natelectasis. Again, the possibility of supervening pneumonia\ncannot be\ndefinitely excluded.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nShe was admitted to the Trauma service.
