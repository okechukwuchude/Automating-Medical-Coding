These findings are\nindicative of independent areas of cortical irritability in the\nposterior quadrants that are potentially epileptogenic as well\nas\ngeneralized cortical irritability.

During her\nshort rehab stint, she developed an episode of \"shakiness\", high\nblood pressures to the 200s systolic, and visual disturbances\ncharacterized as flashes of light in the peripheral visual\nfields, odd shadows/contours around objects in her field as well\nas patchy areas of blindness. During this episode, she was\nconfused. They improved her blood pressure and 12 hours after\nthe onset of symptoms her visual disturbance improved. She\nreceived CT imaging (which \"ruled out\" stroke), as well as\ncarotid US imaging which showed the presence of a right sided\n70% stenosis of the carotid artery. She was once again\ndischarged to rehab.\n\nOver the past two days prior to her ED presentation this time,\nshe was noted to be once again shaky, confused, lethargic and\ndisplaying urinary incontinence. She was noted to be quite\nperseverative and repeating herself, but was comprehending well\nand the language that she used ultimately made sense. In the ED,\nher examination was significant for inattention, inability to\nfollow commands, diffuse paratonia and a possible right lower\nextremity drift. On her statnet EEG, she was noted to have\nmultifocal epileptiform discharges (L>R) and loaded with keppra.\nShe received 1mg of ativan she became more obtunded, bradycardic\nto the 30's and hypotensive, SBP to the 90's. Admitted to the\nICU for further care. EKG was reviewed, sinus with no block,\nrapid repolarization but no significant ST changes and no TWI.\n\nOvernight, there were no acute events. She remained\nhemodynamically stable and her AM labs were all within normal\nlimits. On her second hospital morning, she had difficulty\nproducing words.  On exam, she was afebrile and hemodynamically\nstable with BPs overnight between 90-100 SBP, and satting 93-95%\non 2L/nC. There\nwere no remarkable abnormalities on her general physical\nexamination. Her neurologic examination was significant for a\ntranscortical motor aphasia with preserved repetition,\ncomprehension, [**Location (un) 1131**] but not writing. She also displayed\nbilateral asterixis with brisk reflexes and downgoing toes.\nFormal strength testing was symmetric and full and there was no\ndrift.\n\nGiven her known morphine pump for lower back pain, an MRI could\nnot be performed. The pain service was consulted, and they\nrecommended that an MRI not be performed and that her morphine\npump not be changed in settings. To evaluate the cause for her\nexpressive aphasia, she received a NCHCT and CTA head/neck which\nshowed no evidence of an acute stroke, hemorrhage or mass, but\ndid reveal atherosclerotic disease in both carotid arteries\n(R>L). Given her continued hemodynamic stability, the patient\nwas transferred to the floor EMU service for continued EEG\nmonitoring.\n\nOn the floor, her exam slowly improved with increased\nattentiveness but still some decreased fluency of speech. Her\nEEG did not show any further seizures. To further evaluate the\ncause of seizures, she received a contrast-enhanced Head CT on\n[**2159-1-20**]\nwhich did not reveal any abnormal enhancement. Her Levetiracetam\nwas decreased with the hopes of reducing her dose to a less\nsedating standing dose; she was given 500mg on [**2159-1-20**] PM.\nOvernight, she had a cluster of short seizures around 0215 with\nmotor manifestations which resolved with lorazepam 1 mg. Around\n0630 on [**2159-1-21**], she start to have clinical seizure activity\nagain with left head turn, left eye deviation, and left arm\nmyoclonic jerks which lessened but was followed by left foot\nmyoclonic jerks. She was given another LZP x 2mg without\nresolution. Her\nseizure started involving right hip/knee flexion, and right arm\nraise to the nose. Levetiracetam 1500 mg was bolused, followed\nby another LZP x 1mg and Fosphenytoin 1000 mg. She was\ntransferred back to the ICU for further monitoring and care for\nstatus epilepticus.\n\nThe patient's seizures were able to be controlled on two agents.\nHer fosphenytoin was switched for Vimpat/lacosamide. She was\ntransferred out of the ICU in stable condition and gradually\nimproved with regards to her mental status. She was continued on\nKeppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat 150mg [**Hospital1 **] with no further seizure\nactivity. She continued to improve clinically, and became more\nawake and alert with fluent speech. She remained somewhat\ninattentive and perseverative, and was oriented to place but not\ndate. She continued to have difficulty swallowing as well, and\nfailed several subsequent swallow evaluations. She was\nmaintained on tube feeds via an NG tube until a PEG tube could\nbe placed on [**2159-2-1**]. She tolerated this well and was restarted\non tube feeds on [**2-2**].\n\nShe seen by PT and OT who recommended acute rehab placement upon\ndischarge. She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] in good condition on\n[**2159-2-2**].\n\nTRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:\nPatient will need to remain on Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and Vimpat\n150mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure control. She has a follow-up appointment\nin epilepsy clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] on [**2159-2-26**].

You do have stenosis of\nyour right internal carotid artery which means you should\ncontrol your high blood pressure and cholesterol well and follow\nclosely with your primary care physician.\n\nA feeding tube was placed in your stomach in order to give you\nnutrition as you are still having difficulty swallowing. Your\nswallowing function will continue to be followed by the speech\ntherapists at [**Hospital1 **], and hopefully at some point the tube\nwill be able to be removed if you are able to eat on your own.\n\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\nStarted Keppra 1500mg twice a day\nStarted Vimpat 150mg twice a day\n\nYou should continue the rest of your medications as prescribed.\n\nPlease keep your follow-up appointments as listed below.\n\nPlease seek immediate medical attention should you experience\nany of the below listed danger signs.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou have the following appointment scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]:\nProvider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1220**].
