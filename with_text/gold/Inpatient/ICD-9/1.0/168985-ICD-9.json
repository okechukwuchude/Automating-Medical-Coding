There is exaggeration of normal\ncervical lordosis. NG tube and ET tube are partially imaged. The\nthyroid gland is unremarkable. The partially imaged lung apices\nshow mild paraseptal emphysema. The partially imaged mastoid air\ncells are well aerated.\n.\n[**2183-2-21**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - Evaluation is limited due to\npatient motion. Within these limitations, no acute intracranial\nhemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline\nstructures or mass effect is present. The ventricles and sulci\nare normal in size and configuration. The visible paranasal\nsinuses and mastoid air cells show minimal mucosal thickening in\nthe posterior ethmoidal air cells and the sphenoidal sinus.\n.\n[**2183-2-25**] CXR: The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The NG\ntube tip is in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum appear\nunchanged. There is interval progression of widespread\nmultifocal opacities, highly concerning for multifocal\npneumonia, potential aspiration in origin. Small amount of\nbilateral pleural effusion, left more than right, cannot be\nexcluded. There is no pneumothorax.\n.\n[**2183-2-25**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage.

Patient\nwas successfully extubated and treated with pneumonia. Patient\neloped on [**2183-2-27**].\n.\n# DELIRIUM - During and after extubation, patient intermittently\nvery agitated, trying to get out of bed and punching staff\nmembers - occasionally becoming physical. He was treated with\nPRN IV Haldol for agitation and had an infectious and metabolic\nwork-up for causes of delirium which was unrevealing. Once\nPrecedex was weaned (see below), his mental status improved.\n.\n# ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SEIZURES - Patient with witness generalized\ntonic-clonic seizure activity in the ED. Neurologic exam was\nwithout deficits on admission and head CT imaging was\nreassuring. Toxic ingestion, overdose and alcohol withdrawal\nwere all considered, with laboratory and physical evidence of\nalcohol withdrawal seizure. No clear evidence of toxidrome on\nlaboratory and physical exam work-up. He remained intubated and\nrequired intensive sedation with Midazolam and Propofol\ninfusions, as well as Fentanyl for comfort. Diazepam was started\nvia his OGT as well. We switched him to Precedex to promote\ndown-titration of his narcotics and benzodiazepines, and we were\nable to transition him to PO Diazepam for withdrawal concerns.\nHis electrolytes were optimized, although he had some\nintermittent episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia\nwhich were short-lived and asymptomatic. Multivitamin, folate\nand thiamine were all started on admission.\n.\n# ACUTE RESPIRATORY CONCERNS - Intubation for behavioral issues,\nventilating well, with copious brown liquid being suctioned from\nET tube initially; given these findings, there was some concern\nfor aspiration in the setting of seizure or peri-intubation. He\nhad low grade temperatures without leukocytosis on admission\nattributed to his withdrawal physiology. Given his increased\nsedation requirements, he required mechanical ventilatory\nsupport. His CXR did demonstrated some evidence of pulmonary\ncongestion and possible consolidation concerning for aspiration\npneumonitis vs. pneumonia. He was antibiosed with Vancomycin and\nCefepime for pneumonia coverage given his sputum culture gram\nstain demonstrating gram positive cocci and gram negative rods;\nspeciating commensal organisms only.\n.\n# SINUS TACHYCARDIA - Likely multifactorial and secondary to\nhypovolemia and presumed alcohol withdrawal with sympathetic\noverdrive; no obvious sources of infection and afebrile. EKG on\nadmission reassuring, with improvement in his rate following\nsedation. His electrolytes were aggressively repleted.\n.\n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA - Patient presented with worsening\nthrombocytopenia that stabilized following admission. He\ndemonstrated no evidence of active bleeding. He was maintained\non heparin prophylaxis without issue. He had no evidence of\ninfection.\n.\n# IDENTIFICATION - Identification was confirmed as [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]\nafter 3-days of his hospital stay. Once identification was\nconfirmed, his medication reconcilitation was performed. His\nbrother arrived to confirm his identification.\n.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n** none available per patient, have included past medical\nhistory of [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **], the supposed identity of this patient **\n- Thiamine 100mg daily\n- Aspirin 81mg daily\n- Diltiazem 120mg QID\n- Atorvastatin 10mg daily\n- Isosorbide Mononitrate SR 30mg daily\n- Omeprazole 20mg daily\n- Folic Acid 1mg daily\n- MVI\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis: Alcohol withdrawal seizure\nSecondary Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\npatient eloped.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\npatient eloped.\n\n\n\n"
