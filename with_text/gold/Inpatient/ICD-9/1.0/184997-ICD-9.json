He\ndenies any significant change in this condition recently, but\nhis wife notes increasing swelling and erythema of the extremity\nover the past few days.  He had been rehabbing from an early-[**Month (only) 116**]\nhospitalization for multifocal pneumonia for which he received a\ncourse of CTX/Azithro, and was referred to the ED this morning\nwhen he became febrile to 104.\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 99.2 83 115/59 18 92% RA.  He was\nnoted to be hypotensive to the 80s-90s, and received 2 L of NS\nwith stabilization of pressures to the low 90s.  LLE tib-fib\nfilms showed chronic osteomyelitis without subcutaneous gas, and\na CXR showed stable bilateral effusions from earlier this month.\n He received 2g cefepime and 1g vancomycin.  He had an elevated\nlactate to 3.5 that corrected with fluids to 2.0. Blood cultures\ndrawn prior to antibiotics.  Given his hypotension, he was\nadmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for possible sepsis.\n.\nUpon transfer to the ICU, his initial vitals were T98.1  BP94/54\n P58  RR17  Sat94/4LNC.  He is comfortable and in no acute\ndistress.  He denies any increased pain or fevers recently.  He\nhas intermittent shortness of breath, and notes that he\nsometimes is on oxygen at the nursing home.  He has been a\nresident there for about 2 weeks, and is rehabbing from a recent\npneumonia. He has no coughing or sputum production, however.  Of\nnote, he is in the midst of a azacitidine cycle for his AML,\nwhich was diagnosed in [**2170**].  He saw his oncologist yesterday,\nwho's note details a pressure of 94/64.\n.\nOn review of systems, he denies confusion, weakness, fevers,\nchills, sore throat, coughing, chest pain, abdominal pain,\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, black stools,\ndysuria, hematuria, myalgias, arthralgias.\n\nPast Medical History:\n-Bladder Ca dxed [**2170-8-9**] s/p transurethral surgery (care by\nDr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63724**] with [**Hospital1 **] in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 669**]).\n-AML diagnosed (care by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2405**] at [**Location (un) **]) [**8-/2170**],\n[**9-/2170**] started azacytidine, now s/p 10 cycles, most recent dose\n[**2171-6-3**].\n-atrial fibrillation, rate controlled on fundaparinux\n-HTN\n-Chronic left lower ext ulcer with osteomyelitis and cellulitis\ns/p shrapnel injury in WWII\n- Barrett's esophagus\n- Low back pain\n- Venous thromboembolism?\n\nSocial History:\nLives with wife.

Seven drinks per week.\nNo ilicits.\n\nFamily History:\nDenies history of malignancy.\nNon-contributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVitals: T98.1  BP94/54  P58  RR17  Sat94/4LNC\nGeneral: alert and oriented x3, NAD\nHEENT: Sclera anicteric, very dry MM, oropharynx clear\nNeck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD\nLungs: crackles at the bases, R>L, otherwise clear to\nauscultation bilaterally\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3/6 SEM at the\nsecond RICS without radiation, second SEM at the apex with\nradiation to the axilla.\nAbdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,\nno rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly\nGU: no foley\nExt: The left lower extremity has a 3cmx1cm open wound with\npurulent necrotic discharge at the level of the tibial\ntuberosity. The entire distal extremity is warm, erythematous\nwith 2+ pitting edema that is tender to touch. No other portals\nof entry noted.  Pulses 2+.  Unaffected extremity is warm and\nwell purfused.\nNEURO: CNII-XII intact bilaterally, strength 5/5 throughout, no\nsensory limitations to soft touch.\nLabs: see below\n\nPertinent Results:\nLabs upon admission:\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM BLOOD WBC-3.2* RBC-2.97* Hgb-10.0* Hct-29.5*\nMCV-100*# MCH-33.6* MCHC-33.8 RDW-26.3* Plt Ct-174#\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM BLOOD Neuts-46* Bands-2 Lymphs-27 Monos-12*\nEos-2 Baso-0 Atyps-2* Metas-6* Myelos-3*\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM BLOOD Hypochr-OCCASIONAL Anisocy-OCCASIONAL\nPoiklo-NORMAL Macrocy-OCCASIONAL Microcy-NORMAL Polychr-NORMAL\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM BLOOD Glucose-127* UreaN-31* Creat-1.4* Na-142\nK-4.5 Cl-106 HCO3-25 AnGap-16\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:49AM BLOOD Lactate-3.5*\n[**2171-7-10**] 02:30PM BLOOD Lactate-2.0\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM URINE Color-Straw Appear-Clear Sp [**Last Name (un) **]-1.010\n[**2171-7-10**] 11:40AM URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG\nGlucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-6.5 Leuks-NEG\n\nLabs upon discharge:\n***********\n\nMicrobiology\n[**2171-7-10**]: 1/2 bottles of blood culture: Staph coag negative,\nsensitivities pending\n[**2171-7-11**]: blood culture: no growth to date (preliminary)\n[**2171-7-12**]: Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.\n\nImaging:\nTib/fib X-ray [**2171-7-10**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of\n[**9-13**], there is little overall change. Areas of sclerosis and\nlucency with periosteal reaction is consistent with chronic\nosteomyelitis. Deformity of the adjacent fibula is seen with\nsubstantial resorption at its proximal aspect. No definite\nevidence of gas within soft tissues.\n\nCXR [**2171-7-10**]: IMPRESSION: Little change except possibly for some\nsmall increase in left effusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nDr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88yoM with AML, h/o bladder cancer, chronic LLE\nosteomyelitis, HTN, Afib who presented with lower extremity\ncellulitis and septic hypotension.\n\n# LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY CELLULITIS:  Likely port of entry was\nnon-healing chronic ulcer in left lower extremity.  He was\ntreated with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime starting [**2171-7-10**]\nand will continue until follow up appointment with infectious\ndisease on [**2171-8-1**].  At that point it will be determined if IV\nantibiotics can be stopped and whether oral suppressive\nantibiotics need to be started.  His erythema and edema improved\nover the course of his stay.  PICC line was placed [**2171-7-17**] and\ncan be removed once IV antibiotics are finished.  Once IV\nantibiotics are finished, he will start on oral suppressive\nantibiotics for chronic osteomyelitis.  Note 1/2 blood cultures\ngrew Staph coag negative (sensitive to oxacillin and\ntetracycline), presumed to be a contaminant rather than actual\nbacteremia.  Echocardiogram was deferred due to lack of\nsuspicion for endocarditis and MRI leg was not pursued due to\nclinical improvement on antibiotics and patient resistance to\nsurgical debridement.  His chronic non-healing ulcer/chronic\nosteomyelitis of his left lower extremity is stable in size and\nwithout exudate.  Note weekly labs should be checked including\nCBC with diff, chem 7, vanco trough and LFTs and faxed to\ninfectious disease.  Additionally, vanco trough will need to be\nchecked on [**2171-7-20**], goal trough is 15-20.\n\n# HYPOTENSION:  Initial systolic blood pressure 80-90's prompted\nICU admission, he received intravenous fluids and improved.  His\nfurosemide was restarted on [**2171-7-10**], however his\nantihypertensives were held.  Note recent blood pressures prior\nto admission have been low, so there is a question of whether\nSBP 90-100 is his baseline.\n\n# HYPOXIA:  Resolved spontaneously, suspected atelectasis and\nmild pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia was seen on CXR.  Lasix was\nresumed [**2171-7-13**] once blood pressure was deemed stable.\n\n# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Pre-renal secondary to infection and\nhypotension, resolved with intravenous fluids.\n\n# AML:  Azacytidine was held during admission, but may be\nresumed as an outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2405**].  His hematocrit was 24\nfor several days of admission.  We gave 1 unit PRBC on [**2171-7-17**]\nand another 1 unit PRBC on [**2171-7-18**].  He was mildly neutropenic on\nthe day of discharge (ANC 961), but he was afebrile.   His CBC\nand ANC should be monitored daily for 3 days upon discharge.\n\nHis other medical problems were managed with his home\nmedications without complications.  He was FULL CODE for this\nadmission.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nfrom recent d/c summary and rehab list\n1. atenolol 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n2. fondaparinux 2.5 mg/0.5 mL Syringe Sig: 2.5 mg Subcutaneous\nDAILY (Daily).\n3. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
