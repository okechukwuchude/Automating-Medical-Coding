The feeding tube appears to be coiled within the stomach and\nis not\npost-pyloric. Remainder of the supporting and monitoring lines\nand tubes\nappear in adequate position.\n2. Bilateral lower lobe focal consolidation with air\nbronchograms consistent\nwith pneumonia. Aspiration should be considered given location.\nFurther\ninterstitial and ground-glass opacities likely reflect a\ncombination of\natelectasis and fluid overload.\n3. Ascites and diffuse anasarca suggest fluid overload.\n4. Borderline fatty infiltration of the liver, but no biliary\ndilatation or\nmass lesions to explain patient's liver function test\nabnormalities.\n5. Status post repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm,\nwithout\nevidence for immediate complication.\n\n\nFinal Report\nHISTORY: 64-year-old female, status post repair of descending\nthoracic aortic\naneurysm. Referred for evaluation of persistent fever, elevated\nLFTs and INR,\nand poor tolerance of tube feedings.\n\nCOMPARISON: CT of the chest dated [**2109-5-10**].\n\nTECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging of the chest and abdomen was\nperformed\nfollowing the administration of oral but not IV contrast.\nSagittal and\ncoronal reformatted images were reviewed.\n\nCT CHEST: An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm\nfrom the\ncarina. Tracheal Y-stent is seen with branches extending into\nthe right and\nleft main stem bronchi. Two right-sided central venous lines,\none subclavian\nand one internal jugular, terminate in the distal SVC. There is\nan NG tube\nterminating in the stomach. A Dobbhoff-type feeding tube is also\nseen\nextending into the stomach and is coiled extensively, not\nextending post-\npylorically. A right-sided chest tube courses along the\nposterior margin of\nthe lung and terminates adjacent to the superior mediastinum.\n\nRight-sided aortic arch is again noted. Patient is status post\nrepair of\ndescending thoracic aortic aneurysm, with graft anastomoses seen\nat the level\nof the arch and inferiorly. The graft appears to extend\napproximately 10 cm\nin the craniocaudal direction, and has a diameter of 2.9 cm at\nthe level of\nthe carina. There is no significant mediastinal hematoma. The\nheart and\npulmonary vessels appear unremarkable. Coronary vascular\ncalcifications are\nappreciated.\n\nThere are diffuse reticular and ground-glass opacities in both\nlungs, left\ngreater than right, and more pronounced at the lung bases, where\nthere are\nalso areas of focal consolidation and air bronchograms\nappreciated. The\ncrowding of vessels and bronchi suggests a component of\natelectasis, and\ngeneralized anasarca indicates that a degree of fluid overload\nis also likely\ninvolved. However, an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded;\ndependent\nlocation would suggest aspiration as possible etiology. There is\nno\nsignificant pleural effusion on the right. Pleural effusion on\nthe left is\nsmall.\n\nThere is no mediastinal lymphadenopathy appreciated. There is no\naxillary or\nsupraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\n\nCT ABDOMEN: Oral contrast is seen in the stomach only.\nEvaluation of intra-\nabdominal organs is limited in lack of IV contrast. There is\nmoderate amount\nof ascites present. The liver is of somewhat low attenuation,\nsuggesting\nfatty infiltration. Liver is otherwise unremarkable without\nfocal lesions or\nintra-/extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. Patient is status post\ncholecystectomy. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear\nnormal. The\nleft kidney is unremarkable. There is a large 5 x 6 cm cystic\nstructure\narising from the superior pole of the right kidney and has the\ndensity of\nsimple fluid and is likely a simple cyst. This is unchanged\ncompared to [**Month (only) 547**]\nof [**2109**]. There is no soft tissue stranding or significant\nlymphadenopathy\npresent. There is no free air. Vascular calcifications are seen\nwithout\naneurysmal dilatation.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. The feeding tube is coiled in the stomach. The remainder of\nthe\nsupportive and monitoring devices appear in adequate position.\n2. Status post repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm,\nwith no\nevidence for immediate post-surgical complication.\n3. Diffuse interstitial and ground glass opacities in the lungs,\nleft\ngreater than right, with focal consolidations at the bilateral\nbases. While\natelectasis and fluid overload are present, underlying pneumonia\ncannot be\nexcluded. The location suggests aspiration as possible etiology.\n\n4. Mild ascites and soft tissue anasarca suggests fluid\noverload.\n5. Stable large right renal cyst.\n6. Borderline fatty infiltration of the liver, without evidence\nfor focal\nliver lesions, biliary dilatation, or masses.

Please see operative report for complete\nsurgical details. Post-surgery bronchoscopy revealed right\nmainstem bronchus to still be collapsed. Following surgery she\nwas transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable\ncondition. On post-op day one she was weaned from sedation,\nawoke neurologically intact and extubated. Pulmonary medicine\nwas consulted for stent placement on post-op day two.\nPost-operatively she required several blood transfusions d/t\nanemia. Lumbar drain was removed on post-o p day two. Also on\nthis day she had episode of atrial fibrillation and was treated\nappropriately. She continued to have bouts of atrial\nfibrillation during post-op course. On post-op day three she was\nbrought to the operating room where she underwent Y-stent\nplacement by interventional pulmonology. Later this day she\nrequired a bronchoscopy which found significant mucus retention\nand mucus plug in the lumen of the Y-stent. And had successful\ntherapeutic aspiration. Later on this day she was again weaned\nfrom sedation and extubated. Aggressive pulmonary therapy/toilet\nwere performed but she continued to require several\nbronchoscopies and increasing oxygen requirements over next\nseveral days. Overnight on post-op day six Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was\nprogressively getting more dyspneic and was in respiratory\ndistress the morning of post-op day seven, requiring intubation\nand mechanical ventilation. Respiratory distress and hypoxia\nseemed to be from developing pneumonia (Chest x-rays were\nconsistent with pneumonia and acute lung failure with ground\nglass opacities) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Blood\ncultures taken on post-op day seven were positive for\nEnterobacter Aerogenes and COAG negative Staphylococcus.\nBronchoalveolar Lavage and Urine cultures were positive as well\nand she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics until final\nsensitivities were performed. Also on this day she had\nincreasing metabolic acidosis and hypotension (d/t septic shock)\nand required multiple pressor support. She received similar\nmedical care over the next several days (including multiple\npressors and antibiotics) and infectious disease was consulted\non post-op day 11.\nThe patient remained intubated and her condition worsened with\nthe family asking that the patient be made comfort measures\nonly. The patient was extubated and expired shortly thereafter.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 12.5mg qd, Lipitor 10mg qd, Restasis, Plaquenil 400mg\nqd, Synthroid 100mcg qd, Protonix 80mg qd, Effexor 75mg qd,\nZolpidem 10mg qd, Spiriva, Advair, Albuterol\n\nDischarge Medications:\nPatient Expired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nDescending thoracic aortic aneurysm with aberrant left\nsubclavian artery and Kumeral's diverticulum with aortic sling\ncompressing the right main stem bronchus s/p Right\nposterolateral thoracotomy, replacement of the proximal\ndescending thoracic aortic aneurysm [**12-20**] and Right Bronchial\nY-stent placement [**12-23**]\nPost-op Pneumonia\nPost-op Sepsis\nPost-op Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nPost-op Atrial Fibrillation\nPost-op Anemia\nPMH: s/p Left Carotid to Subclavian bypass [**7-7**], s/p Amplatzer\nplugging of Aberrant left subclavian [**9-6**], Coronary Artery\nDisease s/p Coronary artery bypass graft x 1 (LIMA to LAD),\nConnective tissue disorder with features of Lupus, Sjogren's and\nraynaud syndrome, Stroke, Interstitial lung disease,\nHypothyroidism, Gastroesophageal Reflux disease, Right kidney\ncyst, s/p cholecystectomy, s/p carcinoid tumor removal during\ncolonoscopy, s/p right lung resection?wedge\nAcute lung injury and respiratory failure\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nExpired\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nExpired\n\n\nCompleted by:[**2110-1-28**]"
