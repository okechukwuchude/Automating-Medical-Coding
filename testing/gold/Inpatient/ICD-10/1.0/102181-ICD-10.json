He did not have a prior\ndiagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\n.\nOn Thursday, [**2182-4-25**], he had a hematoma/abscess on his left\ninner thigh that was treated with incision and drainage.\nReportedly, only blood was present and no purulent material.  He\nwas started on Cephalexin, and instructed to pack the wound.  He\nwas feeling well until Sunday, [**2182-4-28**], when he developed\nepigastric discomfort after playing football.  He described it\nas a gnawing pain that he had not experienced before.  He denied\nany nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or other GI\nsymptoms.  He also felt thirsty and drank water.

The\nmediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within\nnormal limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.\nThe visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process\n.\nCT leg:\nFINDINGS: There is minimal skin thickening in the proximal\nmedial left thigh which is asymmetric compared to the right side\nand may represent the area of concern. There is no underlying\nfat stranding, fluid collection or abscess. The fascial planes\nand muscle architecture is well preserved in the thigh.  There\nare some prominent left inguinal nodes, but they all demonstrate\nnormal fatty hila. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous\nlesion is identified.  The visualized portion of the pelvis is\nunremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of abscess.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 23 year old male with no significant past\nmedical history who presented to his PCP with epigastric pain\nand was found to be in DKA with a new diagnosis of diabetes\nmellitus.\n\n# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: He presented in DKA with glucose in the\n300s and an anion gap of 27. He was placed on an insulin drip\nand his glucose normalized, with a drop in his AG to 16 prior to\nreaching the ICU. He was continued on the insulin drip until his\ngap closed. He was supported with NS IVF initially and\ntransitioned to D5NS, and then discontinued when he was taking\nfluids well by mouth. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted as well as nutrition.\nHe was transitioned to subq insulin of 36 units glargine and\naggressive SS. On transfer to the floor, his gap was closed and\nhe was asymptomatic. His electrolytes were repleted\naggressively. He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and received diabetic\nteaching on insulin and diabetic diet. Below is his insulin\nscale upon discharge. He will follow with [**Last Name (un) **] after\ndischarge. Instructed to check finger sticks QIDACHS as he may\nexperience hypoglycemia as he becomes more active and infection\nresolves.

His transaminases, bilirubin, and\nlipase were unremarkable on admission.  There was no evidence of\na separate abdominal pathology.  His abdominal pain had resolved\nby the time he arrived at the ICU and never reoccurred.\n.\n# Left Thigh Abscess: He had an abscess on his left inner thigh\nwhich was treated with surgical I+D on [**2182-4-25**].  He was started\non Cephalexin, which was stopped on [**2182-4-29**].  Reportedly, only\nblood was drained from the lesion, without significant\npurulence.  The patient has been packing the wound according to\ninstructions.  It appeared to be indurated with somewhat poor\nhealing, but no clear evidence of infection. Surgery was\nconsulted and recommended cephalexin, a CT which was negative\nfor abscess, and no need for further I+D.
